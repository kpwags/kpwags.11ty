<h1>/ai</h1>

<section>
	<p>I played around with one of those AI image generators when they first came on the scene a year or so ago becaue I was curious. I got a few laughs out of it, was kind of impressed, but otherwise...just didn't care all that much.</p>

	<p>Since then I've stayed away from AI. I don't use it to write any posts, code, or anything else. Anything and everything you read on this site was written by me.</p>

	<p>For whatever it's worth, I try to block the AI bots trying to suck up my data for their LLMs, but I have no idea how effective it is.</p>

	<p><strong><em>TL;DR;</em></strong> I don't use AI. Period.</p>
