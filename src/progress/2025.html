<h1>2025 Aspirations Progress</h1>

<p>I figured it would be a nice idea to create a page to show my progress on my aspirations for 2025.</p>

<p><em>Last Updated: September 30, 2025</em></p>

<div class="aspiration">
	<h2>Aspiration #1: Complete 12 Video Games</h2>
	<p>My hope for 2025 is to finish 12 games. One a month seems doable.</p>

	{% progressBar "#ff0000" 1 12 %}
</div>

<hr />

<div class="aspiration">
	<h2>âœ… Aspiration #2: Read 45 Books</h2>
	<p>My hope for 2025 is to read at least 45 books.</p>

	{% progressBar "rgb(25, 175, 3)" 53 45 %}
</div>

<div class="aspiration">
	<h2>Aspiration #3: Write 100 Blog Posts</h2>
	<p>My goal for 2025 is to write 100 blog posts, week notes not included.</p>
