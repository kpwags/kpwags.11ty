<h1>Colophon</h1>

<p>This site is built using several tools.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The core of this site is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</li>
	<li>The content for my media pages are stored in a Sqlite database and managed with my <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/wags-media-repository">Media Repository</a> running on my Synology NAS. The downside is that I can only build the media pages from home as the repository is local, but it doesn't cost me anything and I do almost all of my work from home.</li>
	<li>I go back and forth with my writing between <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Regardless of app, when the posts are ready, I copy them into my 11ty directory and they're built there.</li>
	<li>I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> as my domain registrar.</li>
</ul>
