<h1>
	Articles, Podcasts & <span>Other Likes</span>
</h1>

<p>
	One of my biggest sources of finding interesting articles is through my RSS feeds. Feedbin allows me to star items
	and gives
	me the starred items in a feed. These are my starred items.
</p>

<ul class="likes">
	{% for item in likes %}
	<li>
		<div class="title">
			<a href="{{ item.link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
				{{ item.title }}
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="source">
			{{ item.domain }}
		</div>
	</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
