## In Depth

{% inDepth "Nilay Patel" "What is chokepoint capitalism, with authors Cory Doctorow and Rebecca Giblin" "https://www.theverge.com/23547877/decoder-chokepoint-capitalism-cory-doctorow-rebecca-giblin-spotify-ticketmaster-antitrust" %}
    I read this *Chokepoint Capitalism* last year and even wrote [a post reviewing it](https://kpwags.com/posts/2022/12/07/chokepoint-capitalism-a-review). I think in today's current market, it's important to keep in mind how corporations are affecting the ability of people to make a living.

{% inDepth "Dylan Roth" "Deep Space Nine was ahead of its time for all the reasons it was Star Trek's 'problem child'" "https://www.polygon.com/23547617/deep-space-nine-star-trek-ds9-watch-analysis" %}
    Star Trek DS9 is my absolute favorite TV series, it's the series I very often re-watch. It was the first Star Trek series to have an overarching story across all episodes. With *The Original Series* and *The Next Generation*, you could just turn an episode on and generally be fine. DS9 broke that mold which would occasionally make it hard to fully understand what was going on in some episodes. It was also based on a space station rather than a moving starship.

    It dove into some ethical gray areas and didn't have the same feel of “Utopia” that was often seen in *The Next Generation*. It didn't pull punches. It also had two of the best villains in all of Trek. While I'm sure the statute of limitations is over for spoilers given that the series ended over 20 years ago, but I would highly recommend this series.
