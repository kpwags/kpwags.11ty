I just watched [A House of Dynamite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32376165) and oh man does it show the insanity of nuclear weapons.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had read [Nuclear War: A Scenario](https://bookshop.org/p/books/nuclear-war-a-scenario-annie-jacobsen/20335598?ean=9780593476093) by Annie Jacobsen towards the end of last year. The book walked through what the US Government would handle a nuclear strike against us. It did a good job showing how hard it would be to keep a nuclear strike contained to just a strike rather than see it fan out into all out nuclear war. It's pretty scary stuff, especially in today's ever more uneasy world.

The movie plays out in a similar manner to the book albeit on a higher level. It's a scary proposition and it really makes me wish nuclear weapons didn't exist.
