## *Favorite Instrument(s)?*

Guitar, I've finally started to better learn how to play. I would love to get better and get a 12-string. I heard one played live over Christmas break and it sounded amazing.

## *What Song or Album are You Currently Listening To?*

Dennis McCarthy's film score for *Star Trek: Generations*. I tend to prefer soundtracks for writing and the score for *Generations* is amazing.

## *Do You Listen to the Radio? If So, How Often?*

Nope, occasionally I might create a station on Apple Music, but other than that, never.

## *How Often Do You Listen to Music?*

On a daily basis. I often have headphones on while working. Sometimes it's podcasts, but it's often music too.

## *How Often Do You Discover Music? And How Do You Discover Music?*

Periodically. If I do, it's often through Apple Music when I'm seeing what new albums are recommended to me.

## *What's a Song or Album that You Enjoy that You Wish Had More Recognition?*

*Elsie* by The Horrible Crowes. Brian Fallon and Ian Perkins did a single album as a little side project from The Gaslight Anthem and every song on the album is amazing.

## *What's Your Favorite Song of All Time?*

Ugh, it's really hard to choose. If I really had to choose, it'd be [*I Just Want to Sell Out My Funeral*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwrsrsauHfI) by The Wonder Years. It's also an amazing song to end the album [*Greatest Generation*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lYWw7s8GSngREdFbWlH6hud93YEyDMHa0). Seriously if you decide to listen to it, listen to it in order.

## *Has Your Taste in Music Evolved Over the Years?*

Absolutely, I was much more interested in nu-metal and pop punk in high school and college. As I got older, I got much more interested in other genres and more mellow songs. My taste is still eclectic.
