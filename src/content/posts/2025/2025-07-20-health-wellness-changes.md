Over the last couple months, I've seen my weight and progress tick back up. I was making decent progress earlier in the year, but I seem to have hit a wall and backslid a bit. It's not the end of the world, but I think I want to experiment some over the next month or so to see if I can't turn things around for the better.

## Screen Time

I've gone back to playing around on my phone more than I'd like. I think last week's screen time report was around 5 hours a day. That's far too much. I want to see about drastically cutting down on the time I'm mindlessly on my phone.

A while back, I moved my phone out of the bedroom and went back to an old fashioned alarm clock to prevent me from putzing around with my phone right before bed or right as I wake up. It's been good. I think I might try to do something similar during the day.

## More Lifting & Running...Maybe Some Biking Too?

It unfortunately is the middle of summer, so outdoor activities aren't exactly always ideal. I don't particularly like the idea of even walking in 90 degree weather, pushing myself harder with runs or bike rides feels is just a bad idea. Regardless of how uncomfortable I would get being soaked with sweat, it's dangerous and ultimately unnecessary. What good is getting more active going to get me if I'm dealing with heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

But for the days where the weather might be on the "cooler" side, I'm going to push myself to get outside and get some runs in, maybe in the morning before work (although I really like the lunchtime runs to break up the day and put me in a better mood for the afternoon). I might also dust off the bike and see about getting some bike rides in.

With lifting, I've been trying to get back into the routine, but often failing for one reason or another. In some cases its because it's legs day and I'll do anything to get out of doing legs day, including going for runs in the mid-80s when I would still prefer to be inside. Other times I just don't feel like lifting and do something else instead. That's probably the habit I need to break the most.

## Better Food Tracking & Less Snacking

I've been tracking my food intake for a while now, but the one thing I've been lazy about too often is tracking some of the small snacks I might grab throughout the day. I'll often rationalize it by saying to myself it's just a small bit of cheese or what have you. Once in a while isn't the end of the world, but working from home every day has the one downside that food is always available and it becomes a little too easy to mindlessly grab a small snack here and there. Each one isn't a big deal, but as a whole, they add up. I need to work on my willpower and determination to fight the urges to mindlessly snack.

To go along with the better tracking, I want to get better at hitting my macronutrient goals. I've been tracking my intake of calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, & potassium. I want to start to focus more on getting my diet in check to hit those targets. Life's too short to be so completely strict as to limit any and all culinary enjoyments, but I'm hoping to get better about my food intake in hopes that it will improve things.

I know this is all a journey and I'm not looking to look like some model...that ship has ***long*** since passed, but any little health and mindfulness improvements would be good.
