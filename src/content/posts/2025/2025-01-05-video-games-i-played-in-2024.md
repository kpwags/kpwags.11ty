I played more games in 2024 than I had in years prior. It's part of the reason I want to tackle more of my backlog this year.

	I've loved the <em>Horizon</em> series and this was a nice addendum for Forbidden West.

	I had started this game so many times but never finished. I'm glad I did this time. I enjoyed it. The story was decent, but set up the rest of the trilogy well.

	The game grew on me. Initially I thought I liked the original better, but I think thatâ€™s changed. This game had some good fights and better character building.

	I enjoyed the gameplay and they tied up the story pretty well. Ending was fitting, but partially disappointing at the same time. Although that could be my investment in the story and what I hoped would happen.

	This was my first Ratchet & Clank game and I enjoyed it. It was fast paced and enjoyable. Some of the battles felt a little repetitive but not too bad.

	The story was phenomenal. Gameplay was mostly fun, but sometimes incredibly frustrating.

	I remember playing this game as a kid. They did a fantastic job on the remake keeping all the good parts. The gameplay is fun as it was before and a different kind of Mario story.

	I liked the gameplay a little better in this game compared to the first. The story continued to be captivating as well.
