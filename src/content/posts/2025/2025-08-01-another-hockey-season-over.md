Last night, the *Bombers*, the hockey team I captain played their final game of the season. It was an 8-3 win with solid play from everyone. Now I have a little over a month of limited hockey to rest and recharge.

This past season wasn't one of our strongest as we ended up finishing 4-11-1 and missed the playoffs. While a bit disappointing, it was still a fun season and the games we lost were mostly close games.

I have 3 weeks and 3 games left in the other league I play in and then I'll have no games until mid-September when the fall/winter *Bombers* season starts back up. There might be some practices mixed in there, but otherwise I'll be off the ice.

While I'm going to miss playing, I do appreciate the breaks to allow my body to recharge. I don't play in a checking league so I'm not getting beat up like the pros, we all have work the next day, it's still a demanding physical sport (it's definitely a good cardio workout). Some breaks to rest can be appreciated, especially since this last season seemed somewhat condensed with several weeks containing multiple games. It'll also nice to not have late games regularly mucking up my sleep schedule.

Time to hit the gym to get ready for next season.
