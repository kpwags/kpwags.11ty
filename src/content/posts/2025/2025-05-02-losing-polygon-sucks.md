The other day it was announced that the popular gaming and entertainment site [Polygon was sold off](https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant) and that many of the site's writers were laid off. It was one of my go-to sites for video game news and I suspect that given the loss of staff, will not be the same.

This [site](https://haunts.neocities.org/polygon) looks to be spun up to show some alternatives. Might have to give them a look-see. I don't game as much as I used to, but I still like seeing what's coming out and what's going on in the gaming community.
