My week notes for the week of February 9 through February 15.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Go Birds

For the second time in their history, and in the last 8 years, the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl. This year they did it in decisive fashion and dominated Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. My wife and I had a great time with some snacks sitting on the couch cheering them on. As a Philly sports fan, we don't see this too often.
