Other than the intense heat, July wasn't a bad month.
<!-- excerpt -->

### Hockey Tournament

In mid-July, the hockey rink I play at puts on a weekend tournament. Every team is guaranteed 4 games, with the possibility of a 5th if you're one of the top 2 teams in your division (by skill-level). 1 game Friday, 2 Saturday, and 1-2 Sunday. It's my third time playing in the tournament and ended up having a lot of fun. We didn't get to the championship, but had a good time playing. By the end, my legs were gassed and it was only made worse by a game Monday and another Tuesday for the leagues I play in. All in all, it was a lot of fun, but I was happy to be off my legs afterwards.

### Refocusing on Fitness & Screen Time

I've realized over the last few months, my diet and my screen time have been on the wrong trajectory than I would like. For the last 2+ weeks I've been trying to do a better job at focusing on snacking less and paying better attention to what I eat. I've had some mixed success here, but I'm feeling a bit better.

I've also made a concerted effort to get back into strength training and making sure I'm getting some cardio in through runs. The heat has been making the running a little harder, but I've made some progress making sure I'm lifting again. My disdain for legs day has sometimes made me make excuses before, so I'm trying to ignore that voice in my head.

As for screen time, I have drastically cut my use of the phone down. I wish I could say how much screen time I was using prior to my changes (The newer iPhones with their always on screen inflates screen time even if your phone is just sitting there doing nothing), but I'm hovering around 1 hour now, which is definitively drastically lower than before. I don't really have a set goal per say, I just have been trying to not always reach for it as often as I used to.
