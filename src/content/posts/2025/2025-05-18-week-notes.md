My week notes for the week of May 11 through May 17, 2025.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Strength Training

I lifted a lot more this week than I have the past month or two. It was sort of necessary as we got a lot of rain which made walking and running not a very good option. Needless to say, my muscles hate me right now, especially my legs.

### DOOM Guy

I've been listening to the audiobook of John Romero's [Doom Guy](https://bookshop.org/p/books/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-john-romero/18230638) and have been amazed at listening to some of the things he and John Carmack were able to do with the early video games like DOOM and Quake. It's been a good listen/read so far and I'd recommend it. It's inspired me to get back more into developing my side projects.

### Ubuntu

I recently decided to get Linux running on my desktop as a dual boot option with Windows. I started with Fedora and was running into some stability issues. It's been a little while since I've really used Linux so I'm not sure if there was an easy fix I wasn't aware of. I opted to go back to my Linux distro of choice back in the day and so far things are running well. I'm still getting it up and running, but it's been stable.

### Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

I started playing [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.expedition33.com/) as I heard good things about it and found that it was available with Game Pass on my Xbox. It's been starting out slow, but I've enjoyed the little bit I've been playing it. It reminds me of Super Mario RPG with some elements from Elden Ring.
