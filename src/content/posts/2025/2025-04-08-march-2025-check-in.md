March was a mostly quiet month.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Cory Doctorow

I read a lot of Cory Doctorow. Both his [books](https://craphound.com/shop/) and his [blog](https://pluralistic.net). I appreciate his writing and was able to catch him when he stopped by [The Doylestown Bookshop](https://doylestownbookshop.com). It was an interesting event to hear his thoughts on the current political climate and antitrust, as well as the Internet Archive and Wikipedia.

## Tess in a Routine

We’ve had [Tess now for two and a half months](/posts/2025/01/19/week-notes/). We’re getting her into a good routine and she seems to be better adjusting to her new home. It’s caused me to be walking a lot more as we’ve been trying to get her out on 3 walks a day. They’re not always long, but we’re trying to help her burn off some of that puppy energy. She’s walking a lot better now too.

## Writing More

The weather has been turning to spring lately and I’ve been taking advantage of that by sitting out on the porch in the evenings. I’ve been spending that time writing more and have made some more progress on my novel as well as some blog posts.

## Running

For the last several years, I’ve been trying and failing to start running distance again. I’ve been taking advantage of the nice weather to hopefully start running more and work up to longer runs. I was able to hit a little over 8 miles at the end of the month so hopefully I can keep it up and the weather will cooperate.
