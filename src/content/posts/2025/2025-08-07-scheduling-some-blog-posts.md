One of my goals for 2025 was to write 100 blog posts. I'm currently at 50, so halfway there, but we're now almost 60% of the way through the year, so I'm a little behind. I think I'm going to try to schedule some posts from my backlog of half-written posts and ideas.
<!-- excerpt -->

I've started several posts over the course of the year that I've either put off or abandoned for various reasons. Sometimes it's me not sure if the post or my idea is good enough to be worth continuing. Other times I just have forgotten about it or shifted focus.

I've been making a concerted effort over the last month to write more, dedicating 30 minutes or more to it more nights than not. But my writing focus has also been directed towards finishing my novel, which is a whole thing in and of itself. I haven't spent as much time looking at blog posts or shorter form essays and the like.

I'm going to try to add some scheduled to dos to get some posts out, hopefully on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm hoping that by specifying the post and the date, it will give me the oomph to do it. And if I need more time for the given topic, maybe it'll also give me the motivation to come up with something else to share.

Here's to hoping I can go through my backlog to get some more posts out.
