The older I get, the faster it feels the world is going. I’m not sure what to make of that, but alas, it’s happening and there’s not much I can do about it. May wasn’t a particularly noteworthy month, it just sort of was.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Hip Pain & Lack of Exercise

May was frustrating from a fitness point of view. I tweaked my hip playing hockey. It really limited what I could do. There were even some days where walking was uncomfortable. As I've gotten more into staying active, I get a little punchy not being able to go out and be active be it for walks, runs, or really anything.

I finally started feeling better towards the end of the month and was able to slowly get back into things. It's part of the curse of getting older, you recover slower...though it beats the alternative.

## Beautiful Weather Out on the Porch

May was full of gorgeous weather that allowed me to be out on the porch. I love being able to be out there and there's often only a small window where the weather isn't unbearably hot and the mosquitoes aren't super bitey. I took advantage of it to work on my side projects, write, and go through my RSS feeds. As I write this, the temperature is in the high 80s, so hopefully the temperature drops a tad and I can get a few more days before the dog days of summer.
