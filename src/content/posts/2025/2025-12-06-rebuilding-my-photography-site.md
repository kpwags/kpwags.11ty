Several years ago, my site included a photography page where I shared some of the photos I took along my travels. During one of my various redesigns when my site was running Next.js, I was running into build issues with it. I made the decision to split the page out but never actually did. I think that's going to change.
<!-- excerpt -->

I haven't really done much with my DSLR of late. I haven't really taken it anywhere of late which hasn't helped motivate me either. There's also the fact that I haven't finished processing two photo sets I took before the pandemic. Part of the issue there at least was me struggling to find a good replacement for Adobe LightRoom. I got tired of paying for the subscription and it took me a while to find ON1 to replace it. I'm still dragging my feet and learning it.

My ideal situation is to have a subdomain, photography.kpwags.com set up to show off my photo sets as well as maybe a monthly dump from my iPhone of any photos that seem worth sharing. I doubt I'm all that interesting, but I have enjoyed the art of photography even if I haven't taken my Canon 60D out all that recently.

My technology of choice will undoubtedly be 11ty. I love its ease of use for both my site and my [hockey team's site](https://bombershockey.org). I'll have to figure out a good way to host the images as I used to just include them in the build, but given their size, a CDN might be a little more in order.

One thing I'm actually looking forward to experimenting with is the masonry layout being incorporated within browsers and CSS. I've only glanced at it in my periphery so I'm not quite sure what the status is, but I feel like a photo gallery of sorts would be a good use for it.

I don't really have a timeline for when I want it to be out in the world, but now's as good a time as any to start digging into it and coming up with some kind of design and implementation.
