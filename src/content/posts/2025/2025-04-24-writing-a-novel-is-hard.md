Last year, one of my goals or aspirations was to finish the novel I had started. Needless to say, while I most certainly made progress on it, I didn’t even finish a first draft. To state something that should be beyond obvious, writing a book is hard!
<!-- excerpt -->

I’m around 70,000 words into what was originally going to be a short story, but has since morphed into a novel. My issue is that I’m not sure where I want to go with it. I had a general outline of the story, but it’s since been tweaked and adjusted as I‘ve written and developed more of the plot. But now I’m questioning if my original ideas are believable and how to get the reader to them.

It’s kind of a modern science fiction story so I guess it doesn’t have to be completely in line with belief, but I’m struggling to figure out how I want things to go.

Maybe I just need to stop overthinking it and just go with it and write the progression no matter how unbelievable it feels. Words to paper is often what I hear. Maybe that's just what I need to do. Finish the story, and revisit it if it feels to "crazy".

Writing is hard.
