My week notes for the week of April 6 through April 12.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Site Design Tweaks

I’ve been tinkering with the design of my site over the last few weeks. Nothing major, but I was able to finish up and get it out the door. I doubt it will be the last time I tweak things.

### Back on Bluesky and Mastodon

I’m back on Bluesky & Mastodon. I’ve set time limits on my phone to keep me honest, so I’m not sure how active I’ll be, but I’m back I guess.

### My Poor Legs

With all the running I’ve been doing, I’ve been neglecting strength training. On Tuesday I did my first strength training session in over a month, and it was a legs day. I was feeling fine the next day so I went for a 5 mile run. Thursday and Friday however, my legs caught up with me and are none too happy. I’ll have to make sure to keep mixing in some strength training to limit the DOMS.

  Maintaining open source libraries and tools is a hard and thankless job. It’s important to remember that there are people behind them putting their time and effort into maintaining and supporting them.
  I can’t really be all that mad about them wanting to be compensated for their hard work. <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR">MediatR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper">AutoMapper</a>, &
