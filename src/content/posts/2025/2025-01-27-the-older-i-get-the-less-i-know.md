Listening to the lyrics to the song *Some of It Was True* by *The Menzingers*, it made me think about where we are as a country and how there's a large portion of the country idealizing the past.
<!-- excerpt -->

The second verse really got me.

<blockquote>
Nostalgia's never quite as it seems<br />
Rose-coloured glasses on everything<br />
Sparkle like a diamond ring<br />
I'm so sick of playing pretend<br />
Thinking everything was better back then<br />
It's hard to remember the bad parts<br />
I thought that I knew it all<br />
The older I get, the less I know<br />
And I knew nothin' then
</blockquote>

The song isn't really about politics, it seems more about past relationships. Even so though, it seems rather apt for a lot of what happens. Too often we look back at the past thinking it was all sunshines and rainbows. Sure, there are good things that we might miss today, but it's important to look at things as a whole.
