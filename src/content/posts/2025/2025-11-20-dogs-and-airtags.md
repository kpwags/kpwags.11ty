Something that makes me chuckle but also makes me sad is dogs and AirTags.
<!-- excerpt -->

We put an AirTag on Tess's collar in the off-chance she gets away from us. It's attached neatly to her collar and it gives us some peace of mind knowing it's another tool to help us find her should the need arise. One thing that has made me chuckle, but also go "awww..." is when we drop her off at day care, the groomers or to be boarded, and we get the following notification:

> Tess has been left behind.
