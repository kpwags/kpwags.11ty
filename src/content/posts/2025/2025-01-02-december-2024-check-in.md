December came and went. The holidays are over and 2025 is upon us.
<!-- excerpt -->

I wish I could say I got all festive for the holidays, but outside putting up the Christmas Tree, I just wasn't really in the spirit for holidays. I'm not sure if it's the feeling of doom the next four years are looking to bring or what, but I just wasn't feeling it.

## Finished Media Repository Rewrite

I finished my HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS rewrite. It was super fun to build, and it's been working really well.

## New Project

Not to get bored, I started a new project. I'm still sorting out the details, but I'll be building it with .NET and Blazor. I'll describe more once I see if it ends up being viable.

## Some Rest and Relaxation to End the Year

I ended up taking the last 2 weeks of the year off from work around the holidays. It was a nice break from the grind of work. I spent the time with family for the holidays, and at home resting and relaxing.

On Christmas Eve I cooked a large seafood feast for my wife's side of the family. The food turned out excellent. For Christmas, we just went up to my parents' house to spend the afternoon and dinner with all my siblings since my brother was in from Colorado.

After Christmas, we went to a Dave Hause concert in Philadelphia and a Menzingers show in Ardmore. It was a nice way to end the month, and the year.
