My week notes for the week of January 26 through February 1.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Back Into Lifting

This month started out good in the strength training department, but then I shifted more towards walks. That only increased when we got Tess. But I'm hoping to get some more sessions in amongst the dog walks.

### Starting Work on the Fence

Since Tess has learned she can jump the fence, we've been forced to keep her on a leash and harness. That's not ideal for her as she needs space to run around and burn off energy. The dog park can help, but we can't always take her there. After talking with my father in-law, we were able to get the materials to raise the picket height on our fence to 6 feet. This should be enough to keep her in and allow her to run around in our backyard. We got the permit from our township and have started work.

### Trying to Schedule Out My Days

In an attempt to help keep myself organized, I've started to schedule out my days. It might seem a little extreme, but I'm hoping to use it as a way to keep myself focused on the different things I want to do. I have had mixed success with it so far, as things pop up here and there, but I think it's helped me focus in on getting me to sit down and write. I'll count it as a win right now.
