A little over a week ago there was a little bit of a buzz going around about how [Americans are holding onto their devices longer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/23/how-device-hoarding-by-americans-is-costing-economy.html) and claiming that this is damaging to the economy.
<!-- excerpt -->

Oh brother...

In a past life, I was definitely someone who wanted the latest and greatest phone, tech and many other things. Nowadays, I want what I purchase to last. My phone is a three year old iPhone 14 Pro Max, my Laptop is a 2020 M1 MacBook Pro. Both are working fine and neither is giving me any reason to upgrade to the latest model. They both do everything I need them to do and both still feel snappy.

Why should I spend thousands of dollars to upgrade? It's wasteful. I mean sure I'd either re-sell my laptop on Craigslist to hopefully give it a second life, or use Apple's recycling program, but computer parts are notoriously hard to recycle and often hazardous to the humans across the ocean who do a lot of the work.

As for the article and blaming people like me who are holding onto our devices longer for the economy, I have two things to say.

First, it's good to see people recognizing their older devices are still good to hopefully help cut down on e-waste.

Second, the economy is hurting because there's an affordability crisis. Life's basic necessities are getting far more expensive so income that might've otherwise gone towards the "nice to haves" are now being directed towards important things, like groceries. The latest iPhone isn't going to mean much to someone trying to make sure they have food on their table and a roof over their head. If you want to help the economy, help those who are struggling afford what they need to survive.

I'm tired of living in the dumbest timeline possible...
