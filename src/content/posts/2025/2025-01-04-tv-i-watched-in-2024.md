Most of the TV I watched this year was with my wife, though I managed to watch a few of the ones on my list as well.

	I was so sad when they announced season 5 was the last season. I loved this series. It did such a fantastic job of mixing humor and the essence of Star Trek. So many great Easter eggs as well. It’s such a shame that it was cancelled so soon.

	Season 1 of The Last of Us was amazing. It did such a great job bringing the first game to the screen. I can't wait for season 2.

	The show had its ups and downs. I enjoyed most of the stories and its characters. It’s a shame it had to end so soon.

	I really enjoyed this. Had some great characters, good humor, and was down to earth. Kind of want to get into soccer now.

	We made it through season 4 and it's been enjoyable. A good cast, with some good laughs.

	It was a good look at what happened with Challenger. I maintains the focus of the human side while also looking at the warnings NASA received and its lack of action that caused the tragedy.

	There were some stories I enjoyed more than others, but these were enjoyable additions to the franchise. My favorite was definitely “The Trouble with Edward”.

	I enjoyed this. Showed how awful was was and what hell the Pacific Theater was.

	This is one of the better reboots I've seen. Good characters and good laughs through 2 seasons.

	Both seasons were kind of weird. Definitely Stephen King inspired, but not sure how much I liked it.

<media-box

	As someone who enjoys cooking, I enjoy Alton's sense of humor in his explaining of different foods and their preparation.

<media-box
	title="Death and Other Details"

	It wasn't too bad, characters weren't bad and a good mystery thriller.
</media-box>

<media-box
	title="Catch-22"

	Not a bad adaptation of the book. Ridiculous in all the right parts.
</media-box>

<media-box
	title="Halo"
	image="https://i.postimg.cc/zfq7tSvT/halo.jpg"
	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2934286/"
	rating="2"

	So much wasted potential. I love Halo, but this never really came close to the lowest of my expectations. It’s a shame it missed the mark, there is so much lore that they just constantly bungled.

<media-box
	title="Designated Survivor"

	Some parts were interesting, but sometimes the show felt like it just dragged on unnecessarily.

<media-box
	title="Daria"

	It’s an older show, but parts of it still hold up.

<media-box
	title="Cosmos"

	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395695/"

	I thought this was an excellent look into the history of humanity, Earth, the Solar System, the Milky Way and more. Neil deGrasse Tyson did a fantastic job as host. I’d highly recommend this.
