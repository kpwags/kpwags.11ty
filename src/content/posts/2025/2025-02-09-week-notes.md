My week notes for the week of February 2 through February 9.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Fence Up

My father-in-law, myself, & my wife were able to get our new fence erected to help keep Tess contained. My wife and father-in-law did most of the work and it looks amazing. Tess loves being outside, so it will be nice to allow her to just hang out outside without us having to worry about her easily escaping.

### Going Through My RSS Feeds

I've spent a fair amount of time this week going through my large backlog in my RSS reader. I probably should be more liberal in my use of "mark all as read", but alas I'm more inclined to read the blog posts and articles even if they're a month old or older.

### Gearing Up for the Super Bowl

Normally I don't care all that much about the Super Bowl, but the Philadelphia Eagles are in it again so I'm excited to cheer on my team.

I don't understand why people think HTML isn't a programming language, at least in the general sense. It takes skill tor write good, well-formed and accessible HTML. Add to that how many people are doing the same thing through JavaScript, I don't get the hate or condescension.

I would love to see more classic games being "updated" to run on modern hardware. If this helps game studios open up their back catalog, I'm all for it.
