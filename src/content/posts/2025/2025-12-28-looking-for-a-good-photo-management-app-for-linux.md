Now that I'm using [Linux Mint as my daily driver](/posts/2025/12/23/linux-as-a-daily-driver/), I realize that I don't have an application lined up to use to handle organizing and processing my photos. This is going to be needed for my photography site.
<!-- excerpt -->

For the longest time I was an Adobe LightRoom user. I actually really liked the software. But then I got tired of paying Adobe for the privilege of using it. I didn't like the idea of having to pay them monthly to use a piece of software knowing that as soon as I cancelled my subscription, there goes my ability to go through my photos.

I had bought a license for LightRoom 6, but I could not get it to run on my M1 MacBook Pro. For some reason it kept crashing when it opened. It was who knows how old and while it worked just fine back in the day, I didn't want to spend the time and the hassle keeping it running without crashing, so I opted to move on. I tried [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), it looked promising, but felt really sluggish. I ended up settling on [ON1](https://www.on1.com/) and was having some success with that, but it's a MacOS app and doesn't run on Linux. I could stick with it, but it'd be nice to be able to have everything working and running on my Linux Mint box.

So I'm now in the market for a new photo management app. My first target will again be Darktable. Maybe I'll have a better experience with it this time. But if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
