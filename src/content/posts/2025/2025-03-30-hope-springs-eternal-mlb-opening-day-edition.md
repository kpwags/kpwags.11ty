Baseball season has begun and hope springs eternal.
<!-- excerpt -->

There’s a line from the song [“Roman Candles” by Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAtNg8hl4Eo) that comes to mind.

<blockquote>
Ain't that the thing about hope?<br />
Ain't that the thing about hope?<br />
Each Spring the Mets will win the pennant<br />
and your grass is gonna grow<br />
ain’t that the fucked up thing about hope?
</blockquote>

I’m obviously a Phillies fan and am not a fan of the Mets, but like Mets fans, Philly fans are often very optimistic about seasons at the very beginning.

For Philly fans, it’s actually not a bad time. Eagles just won the Super Bowl and look to continue to be competitive. The Phillies are playoff contenders with a star-studded roster. The Flyers and Sixers...well, two out of four ain’t bad.

Let’s Go Phillies!
