February was kind of a busy month for me. Work has been a little hectic, we’re making sure to put in the time training Tess, it’s just sometimes felt like a blur. Thankfully it’s not a bad busy.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Holy Moly that was a Good Super Bowl

As an Eagles fan, Super Bowl LIX was a lot of fun to watch. The Eagles played to their talents and their defense just shut Mahomes and the Chiefs down. It wasn’t just that they won, it was the way they won. You love to see it. We opted to avoid the parade this year. The parade in 2018 was a lot of fun, but it was hard to get into the city with all the crowds.

## I Can No Longer Simply Ignore Politics

I’ve generally tried to limit writing and sharing politics. It’s never been that I don’t care, I’ve just tried to focus on other topics. With the current state of the U.S. and with Trump turning the country I’ve grown up into an authoritarian hellhole, I’m not going to be quiet about it and there will be political content included in my writing and sharing. While I don’t think we can keep our head in the sand with what is going on in America, I do have separate feeds for those who really do need a respite.

## Getting Accustomed to the New Routine with Tess

We’ve had Tess for well over a month now and we’ve gotten into a pretty good routine with her. The training is going well and we’re starting to realize how smart she really is. There’s still adjusting going on on both sides, but we’re hoping it continues to go well.

## The Final Stretch at Work

The project I’ve been focused on at work is reaching the end. Hopefully we’ll release it next week and we can mark it off as a success. It’s taken a lot of time and effort by a lot of people other than just myself and it will be nice to see it out the door. I’m also not going to lie, I’m looking forward to focusing on something else after even though I know there will still be enhancements and fixes coming.
