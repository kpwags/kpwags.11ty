This past year has been a doozy to put it mildly. The beginning of Trump's second term has been chaotic and cruel and has put me all too often in a bad place worried about the state of the world and the future.
<!-- excerpt -->

The inspiration for this blog post came from [Bari Weiss pulling a 60 Minutes segment on CECOT and the Trump Administration sending detainees there to be tortured](https://lite.cnn.com/2025/12/21/media/60-minutes-cecot-bari-weiss-cbs-sharyn-alfonsi). This was almost certainly done for political gain and to shield the Trump White House from bad press. I don't watch much TV news, but I don't think you have to be to recognize that this is just awful journalism and puts the little integrity CBS has left into question.

CBS also operates Paramount+, which is now the (mostly) exclusive home to my favorite TV series. I'm a Star Trek fan. I love the series, the messages they tend to share about fairness, equality, and a better future. They have a new series coming out early next year, and I was planning on re-subscribing to Paramount+ in order to watch it. Now, I'm just not going to. While the Ellison's and Bari Weiss in charge, I don't want to fill their pockets.

So now I have yet another company I refuse to do business with. My list isn't extreme, but I do my best to put my money where my mouth is as much as I can. I unsubscribed to the NYT because of their coverage of trans rights issues, I don't go to Chick-Fil-A because the owner donates money to anti-LGBT groups and laws, as well as others.

I'm not perfect in this by any means, I'm sure I've slipped up from time to time, but I generally want to avoid putting more money in pockets of companies and individuals that are actively working against the values I believe in.

I'm not going to pretend like my little boycotts and protests are going to scare the CEOs into actually doing anything or that my protests even make a difference. What I can say is, they help me feel like I have a *little* control over what is going on. That, and I can sleep a little better at night knowing that I'm doing *something*.
