For those unaware, 18F was a digital agency within the US Federal Government to help with technical services and products. Recently, it was in the news as Elon Musk and DOGE came in and as they are apt to do, ruin a good thing.
<!-- excerpt -->

Prior to all of this though, Ethan Marcotte wrote about his choice to leave. It’s a fantastic piece and I would highly recommend reading it. I applaud him for hold fast to his principles and morals in what I can only imagine to be a tough time and a tough decision.

When all is said and done, the loss of 18F will make us all worse off.
