Whelp, we're now 1/3 of the way through the year, with the fascist asshole running the country into the ground, I'm surprised it's going as fast as it has been.

The Economist's cover is apt.

## Running Distance Increasing

As I've mentioned, one of the things I want to do is run longer distances. This past month, the distance of my average run was almost 5 miles (it had been hanging out between 3-3.5 miles). I was able to hit 9 miles on one run. My only blocker lately has been the weather. The spring rain has not made running particularly appealing.

## Enjoying Our Front Porch

The weather has been nice enough temperature to be able to enjoy our front porch. I took advantage plenty, sitting outside with a glass of whiskey writing and/or reading is a great way to unwind in the evenings.

## Digging Back Into Blazor

Over the last year or two I worked in Blazor both at home and for work. I have a side project I've been slacking off on that I dug back out. I think I'm gonna continue to delve into it and see if I can't increase my knowledge of the platform, particularly the WASM side of things as I've primarily worked with Blazor Server.
