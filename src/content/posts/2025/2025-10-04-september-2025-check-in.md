September was a busy month. One of my teams' hockey season started back up, went to some concerts and generally stayed active.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Concerts

After a busy Labor Day weekend seeing Dave Hause twice, I ended up going to two other concerts in the month. I saw Lucero mid-month when I found out they were doing a show at Ardmore Music Hall, a cool small venue near us. They ended up celebrating the 20th anniversary of the release of [Nobody's Darlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6RoAjmDPBw&list=PL4C072D4A4D7B097E) and then some of their hits. I even got to meet their frontman, Ben Nichols after the show.

My wife and I also traveled to Asbury Park, NJ to the Stone Pony to see The Menzingers play on the summer stage. It was a fun weekend. Good music, a nice venue and a nice beach town. We'd definitely go back.

## Bombers Season Starts Back Up

The team I captain, the *Bombers* had the fall/winter 2025-26 season start back up. We've played 3 games so far and are a respectable 2-1. Probably could've been 3-0, but I had a crummy game in net in the opener and let too many easy ones in spoiling a good effort by the rest of the team.

## New Project at Work

For work, I've been put on a new project since the work has been slowing down for the one I'd been working on. It's been a pretty big adjustment trying to figure out the new codebase, new terminology, and how everything pieces together and works. I've been working with plenty of current and former teammates who have been doing a great job helping me out. I have no doubt I'll pick it up, just goes with the theme of [safety of the known](/posts/2025/10/03/the-safety-of-what-you-know/).

## Writing More

I've been continuing my goal of writing more. I've done a pretty decent job of getting 2 posts out a week beyond my week notes and reading logs. I've been trying to set aside 30-45 minutes a day to just get words out. Not always successful, but I'm starting to feel better about my writing.

## Personal Site Redesign

I've been able to get a good chunk of my personal site redesign taken care of. There's still a little ways to go, but I'm feeling better about the codebase. I've been cleaning up old components, deleting bits and pieces as I realize they're no longer needed or merged in elsewhere. I'm hoping it provides a better base for my site.

## Espresso

The other thing I've been trying to do more is take advantage of our espresso machine. We got it somewhere around the pandemic and while it doesn't go unused, I've been making it a point to use it more whether it's for a red-eye in the morning or a latte in the afternoon. Any good recipes anyone knows would be appreciated.
