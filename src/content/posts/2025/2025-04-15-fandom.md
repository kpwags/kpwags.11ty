I'm a huge Philadelphia Phillies fan and a baseball fan. Over the years I've collected a collection of Phillies fitted caps of various different styles. One of the caps I bought was a modern replica of a 1929 Philadelphia Athletics hat complete with World Series patch on the side of it. It got me thinking a bit about how we choose what team to follow and become a fan of.

I'm a Philadelphia sports fan because I grew up just outside Philadelphia. For me and many others around the world, we often become fans of the hometown team, or the team in closest proximity. For me, that was Philadelphia. Others have different reasons for who they root for.

Until 1954, Philadelphia supported 2 Major League Baseball teams. The Phillies formed in 1883, the Athletics formed in 1901. In 1954, the Athletics moved to Kansas City, and eventually ended up in Oakland, and now Sacramento. By the time I was born and started getting into sports, Philadelphia only had 1 baseball team, so it was obvious who I was going to root for. But if the Athletics were still in Philly, would I be a Phillies fan...or would I have latched on to the A's.

I'll never know the answer, nor does it really matter at the end of the day. The hat just made me think about the what-ifs.

For fans with multiple teams in a city, like the Yankees/Mets, White Sox/Cubs, NY Jets/NY Giants...what made you choose the specific team in your city? There aren't really wrong answers, I'm just kind of curious.
