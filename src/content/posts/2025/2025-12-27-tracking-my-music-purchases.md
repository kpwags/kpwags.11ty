I've mentioned before that I've been trying to [purchase more music](https://kpwags.com/posts/2025/08/14/ownership/) rather than relying on streaming services. Something I've started to wonder about is how my music purchases have changed over time.
<!-- excerpt -->

My music collection goes back to probably middle school. There's no way for me to know exactly when I bought my first cassette tape or CD. With my more recent additions, that's obviously a little different. I could certainly go through my email and look for the receipts, but even that doesn't grasp all of it as I don't have the receipts from the vinyl I got at record shops.

Lucky for me, my [music page](/music/) is built off my [media repository](https://codeberg.org/kpwags/wags-media-repository). This means that I can go into the code and [add a field](https://codeberg.org/kpwags/wags-media-repository/issues/141) in the database to start tracking when I purchased the album.

I'll probably end up going through my Bandcamp purchases and see if I can backfill some of the data, but once integrated, it'll be nice to get some kind of visualization of what albums I bought when and how many albums I've bought per year.

This is one of the reasons I love these little home-cooked apps. I built it to solve a problem I had, and can have it do whatever I need it or want it to. I build it for me. Anyone is welcome to download it or to fork it of course, but I have it working the way I want and will continue that.

Little projects are fun.
