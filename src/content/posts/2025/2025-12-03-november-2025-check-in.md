November was a busy month. Thanksgiving, a long weekend in New York City, and a nagging cough were the highlights.
<!-- excerpt -->

## New York City

My wife and I have been spending at least one long weekend in NYC every year since we've been together. We even went in February 2020 just before the COVID lockdowns. This year we had to wait until November but were able to enjoy the sights and sounds of the Big Apple.

We stayed by Bryant Park and enjoyed the mornings with a book in the park with some coffee and pastries with books. They had the ice rink and Christmas shops up. It was a good way to wake up even if it was a little on the chilly side. The rest of the days were spent wandering around the city. We had dim sum in Chinatown, hung out in the Village and enjoyed ourselves. We don't always do all the touristy things when we visit, but NYC has so much to offer.

## Hosting Thanksgiving

We hosted my in-laws for Thanksgiving. It wasn't all that bad as we ended up getting some prepared foods from Wegmans to make it easier on us. At the end of the day, it's about family and we had a good time with family.

## Off-and-On Cough

Throughout the month I had a rather annoying nagging cough. Some days it was bad, but then I'd be fine. It was weird. Kept me home and inside. Sadly missed a Dave Hause show, but I didn't want to spread whatever I had so alas I'll have to wait until May to see him live again. Thankfully it seems to have gone for good and it was still better than whatever the heck I had Christmas 2023.

## Writing and Video Games

I was able to finish [Expedition 33](https://www.expedition33.com/) at the beginning of the month before my Game Pass subscription lapsed. I decided that my next game would be [Jedi: Survivor](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor). I played the heck out of the game. I enjoyed the gameplay and the story was captivating. There is something satisfying about pulling a stormtrooper towards you and then slicing him up with your lightsaber.

I ended up completing the game Thanksgiving morning. Next up, Far Cry 5.

Needless to say, I lost motivation for writing. My goal of 36,000 words fell by the wayside. Eh, oh well. Dealing with the cough, I sometimes struggled to focus on writing and decided to rest with games or TV.
