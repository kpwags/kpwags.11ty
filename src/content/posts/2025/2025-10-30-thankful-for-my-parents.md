I didn't always get along with my parents. I very often thought they were too strict and were getting in my way of having fun. Now, 20+ years later from my teenage years, I guess maturity has a way of making you rethink things and count your blessings.

I remember reading about the NHL Player [Jack Johnson](https://deadspin.com/how-jack-johnsons-parents-screwed-him-and-left-him-mill-1663583325/) and his financial woes. He signed a 7 year contract in 2011 worth over $30 million and had his parents help him handle his finances. Instead of actually helping him, they took out loans in his name and used his money to buy cars, homes, and who knows what else. It was so bad he had to declare bankruptcy. I never got that kind of money, but if I did that young, I know I could trust my parents to either handle it responsibly, or more likely, point me in the right direction on *how* to handle it.

The older I get, the more fortunate I know I am having two wonderful parents who love me and have always done what was best for me, even when I didn't.
