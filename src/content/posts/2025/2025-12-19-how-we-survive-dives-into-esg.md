I listen to a lot of podcasts from American Public Media. One of their podcasts is [How We Survive](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/how-we-survive), which focuses on climate change and how it affects us. I'm a little behind on it, but season 7 focused on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and I'd recommend it.
