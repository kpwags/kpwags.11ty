My wife and I have a system where we often have movie nights and take turns picking the movie. We continued it this year. We didn't quite hit the count we did last year, but we still tallied 26 this past year.

  De Niro vs. Pacino. They don’t make heist movies like this anymore.

  I really enjoyed this. I thought they did a good job of telling a new story while still paying homage to the past.

  This was slightly predictable, but still an enjoyable follow-up to Afterlife.

  The visuals were amazing for this. The story I believe does the book justice and the casting is fantastic.

  I'd been meaning to watch this for a while and finally got around to it. It was a pretty prototypical action flick. Still enjoyable.

<media-box
  title="The Hateful Eight"

	This was definitely a Tarantino movie. I thought the story was somewhat predictable, but was still enjoyable.

<media-box
  title="Patriot Games"

  link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105112/"
  rating="3"

	A Clancy film with Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan. Definitely shows its age and might be slightly predictable, but still enjoyable.

<media-box
  title="Identity Thief"

  link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432/"

	There's no denying this was dumb. But sometimes dumb movies can still be enjoyable. I enjoyed both Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman in this.

<media-box
  title="Clue"

	I had never seen this before. It definitely had its dumb parts, but it was funny and the cast was good.

<media-box
  title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"

	Definitely liked Raiders of the Lost Ark better. Not sure if it’s time or what, but this felt kind of corny.

## Did Not Like and Could Not Finish

	I just could not even bring myself to finish this. Halfway through I just gave up. It felt creepy and not at all in a good way.

## Everything Else

- [Dark Shadows](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1077368/) - This was strange. Not awful, but strange.
- [My Cousin Vinny](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952) - This had some good points, not sure why it’s considered such a classic though.
- [Anyone But You](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26047818/) - This was a typical romantic comedy. It was mostly predictable but still enjoyable.
- [The Foreigner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615160) - This wasn’t quite what I expected. It was still a decent action flick with some intrigue.
- [The Many Saints of Newark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110232/) - Not really sure I liked it…felt disjointed and with some storylines just never finished or flushed out.
- [Asteroid City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230388/) - This was just weird. I guess I’m not really surprised since it’s a Wes Anderson film, but I really don’t know what to make of it.
- [Sicario](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397884/) - I thought this would be better given the cast. In the end, I felt like several of the characters were superfluous and the story disjointed.
- [Being the Ricardos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4995540/) - This ended up being something completely different than what I anticipated, but not in a bad way. It just showed a different side of the show than I expected.
- [The Accountant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140479/) - There were some decent action scenes, but some characters and roles seemed kind of superfluous, like the movie would have been just fine without them.
- [Won't You Be My Neighbor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7681902) - This was as interesting look back at Mr. Rogers and while not as in-depth as I had anticipated, it was nostalgic and showed how amazing Fred Rogers really was.
- [The Holdovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/) - I enjoyed it. I liked the characters and while the story was somewhat predictable, it was still a good watch.
- [Apollo 13 Survival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31852716) - I thought it was an interesting documentary. I'm still kind of surprised they didn't really talk about the cause of the disaster any though.
- [American Gangster](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429/) - It was an enjoyable movie. Good characters and a good plot. Felt a little dragged out at times though.
- [Office Christmas Party](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/) - This movie was predictable and dumb, but it was funny and enjoyable.
- [The Dead Don't Die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8695030/) - What a strange movie, but the casting fit.
- [The Man from Toronto](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11671006/) - This was about as dumb as I expected it to be. Mostly predictable, but still enjoyable.
