My week notes for the week of May 25 through May 31.

## Notes

### Hip Mostly Better

I've gotten to the point where I really don't like going so many days without getting some real exercise in. My hip issues have been hampering me, but I'm slowly getting some light lifting and running in now that it's mostly feeling better.

### Writing

I've been able to enjoy the nicer evenings out on the porch and have spent a fair amount of it writing. I want to finish the story I wanted to finish last year. It started out as a short story and it's only grown. I'm making progress though.

  As if hiring wasn't hard enough, now you have to be aware of North Koreans applying as well. On a side note, I was asked to be a U.S. contact for a developer who claimed they were in South Korea. Wonder if this was a front for North Korea. (I marked it as spam and deleted it)

  It might be funny if this was satire, but sadly it's not. Maybe the AI industry deserves to die.

  This is a great post about the rise of AI code generation tooling that articulates well about so many of the downsides and what we as developers lose with all the new LLMs that write code for us.
