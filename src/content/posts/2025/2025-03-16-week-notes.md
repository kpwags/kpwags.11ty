My week notes for the week of March 9 through March 15.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Beautiful Weather

This week the weather has been absolutely beautiful sitting in the mid-60ºF temperatures. I’ve taken advantage of it for runs and sitting outside.

### Big Release at Work

The project I’ve been working on for the last 14 or so months at work finally launched this week. Thankfully the release went by pretty smoothly. There were a few small issues as there often are on large releases, but nothing major and we were able to square them away pretty quickly.

Only the first episode, but Mike Masnick (from Techdirt) does a great job starting to dig into Section 230 and why it’s so important for the internet.
