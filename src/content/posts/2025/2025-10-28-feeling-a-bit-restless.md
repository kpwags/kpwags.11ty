I'm not sure whether its because it's the first week back from vacation or maybe the change in the weather, but over the last several days I've just been feeling restless and aimless.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had told myself getting back from vacation I was going to crack down and get some blog posts written as I'm hoping to focus on my novel come November, but want to have some drafts ready to finalize and post as to keep pushing for my goal of 100 posts for the year. Tonight is the first night since getting back that I've actually sat down and focused on writing. And even this took some effort.

I still need to beat Expedition 33 before my Game Pass subscription ends next weekend, but I don't even feel like doing that.

I get in these weird funks from time to time so I'm not terribly concerned. It will pass, just want to feel productive or motivated and for whatever reason, that's just not meant to be this week.

I'm still enjoying my nights on the couch before bed reading, so I guess there's that. I'm almost done my 60th book of the year. It's still kind of crazy I've read that much this year.
