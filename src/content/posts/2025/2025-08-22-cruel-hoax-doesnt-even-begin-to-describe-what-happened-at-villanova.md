As the title says, "cruel hoax" doesn't even begin to describe [what happened at Villanova](https://www.inquirer.com/crime/villanova-university-radnor-active-shooter-20250821.html). For those who might not have seen the news, it appears someone swatted the Villanova University campus claiming a shooter was on the loose. Afterwards, all hell broke loose. Thankfully no one was injured or killed.
<!-- excerpt -->

My wife and I were transfixed on the local news station trying to figure out what was going on. Villanova isn't terribly far from us, and we both know people, including family who went there. It was just one of those situations where your heart just sunk. I can't even begin to comprehend what might have been going through the students' minds, or their parents' minds.

Add to that that the freshman class had just started arriving the day before. Just an awful situation sowing fear and terror. The only silver lining was that it was just a hoax and no one was hurt.

I hope they find the person who did that and they face justice. Just like swatting individuals, the situation could have turned south quickly. It just makes me so angry.
