I’ve been looking at the scale lately and I haven’t liked what I’ve seen. I think it’s time for me to cut back on my food intake and do better at what I eat.

My weight’s been creeping up lately and it’s definitely my own fault. I’ve been eating more and enjoying a beer or two a little more often, and my workouts aren’t going to overcome that. As the saying goes,

> You can’t outrun a bad diet.

It’s the truth. I know it’s coming up on the holiday season, but it’s about time for me to buckle down and better consider my diet.
