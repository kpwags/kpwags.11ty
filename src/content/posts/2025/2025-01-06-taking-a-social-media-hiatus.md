I’ve known for a while that I sometimes spend too much time on social media. I also know with the latest election and upcoming administration, I have a tendency to doom scroll a little too much. In an attempt to regain focus and a little bit of self-care, I’m going to take a step back from all social media.
<!-- excerpt -->

I’ve been considering this for a little while now after the election and the flood of bad news. Having recently read [Digital Minimalism](https://bookshop.org/p/books/digital-minimalism-choosing-a-focused-life-in-a-noisy-world-cal-newport/12081448?ean=9780525536512), it gave me the kick in the ass to do what I should have done before.

I figure it will give me two distinct benefits. First, it will hopefully allow me to focus on my [aspirations](/posts/2025/01/04/my-2025-aspirations/). Second, it will hopefully help my mental health and strengthen me to deal with the next 4 years.

I do intend to remain active on my site here blogging, so don’t hesitate to reach out and reply via email.
