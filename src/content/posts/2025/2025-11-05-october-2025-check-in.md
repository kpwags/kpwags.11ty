I finally was able to enjoy a vacation this month, a much needed vacation. Other than that, it was a mostly quiet month.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Vacation

We went to Cape May for just under a week for a vacation and to celebrate our anniversary. We've been married for 12 years now and it's still kind of hard to believe it's been that long (in a good way). It doesn't feel like it's been that long, but I can't imagine my life without her as my wife.

We stayed in the amazing Congress Hall and had an amazing view from our room. You can't beat waking up and looking out at the ocean.

## I-League Hockey Season Starts Back Up

We're now 3 games in to the season in the other league I play in. I play goalie in this one and we're a respectable 2-1. We lost the first game in a close one 3-1. I missed the next one while I was in Cape May, but the team won that one 3-1. The third game did not go well for me, but the team bailed me out and we ended up coming from behind and winning 7-6. It's an 8 game regular season, so we're off to a good start, but still plenty of games to go. I'm feeling good despite my lackluster performance in the last game.

## Writing

I took advantage of the quiet time at wineries and breweries, as well as the veranda at Congress Hall with my iPad to write. I didn't get as much done as I had hoped, but still got words to paper which is important.

## Site Updates & Bombers Hockey Website

I finished my site updates and got them deployed. Not too much has changed from a visual perspective. I cleaned up a lot of the 11ty code and the CSS. Let me know if you see something off.

I also ended up building a [website for my Bombers team](https://bombershockey.org), also in 11ty. It's nothing fancy, but why not, we've been around for 8 years now.

## Mad Dash to Finish Expedition 33

I'm in a mad dash to finish Expedition 33 before my Game Pass subscription expires. I've enjoyed the game, though I'm worried all the breaks I've taken will hurt my understanding of the story's finale. Still gonna push through. Can always purchase it for another play-through. It's apparently a good game for that which I can appreciate, though my large backlog is beckoning.
