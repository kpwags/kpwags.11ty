Last year, my Phillies eked into the playoffs and then proceeded to knock out the St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, & San Diego Padres to make
it all the way to the world series. There, they sadly lost to the Houston <s>Cheaters</s> Astros. This year, they're back in the playoffs and already
took out the Miami Marlins to reach the NLDS for a rematch against the Braves.

I'm psyched and excited to watch them make another World Series run!
