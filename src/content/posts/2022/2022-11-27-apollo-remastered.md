At the recommendation of [Kai Ryssdal](https://mastodon.world/@kairyssdal) from [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/), I ended up purchasing a new coffee table book called _Apollo Remastered_. And oh man was it worth the purchase.
<!-- excerpt -->

All the film taken during NASA's Apollo Program has been placed in cold storage to protect and preserve them. Andy Saunders has been taking the film and digitizing it and then enhancing the photos taken by the Apollo astronauts for this book. Needless to say, the photos are amazing. I haven't gotten through a quarter of them and I'm blown away.

If you're a fan of NASA, space, or are interested in the history of the moon landings, I would highly recommend buying this book.
