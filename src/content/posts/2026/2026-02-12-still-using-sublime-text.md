I know there's been some pushes to VS Code, Zed, Cursor and others, but for so many projects I work on, I've been sticking with the tried and true, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). It's fast, it's light-weight, and it's still my go-to 14 years later.
<!-- excerpt -->

I purchased my first license to Sublime Text in January 2012. I'm pretty sure it was version 3 at that point. I've since upgraded to version 4, and have renewed the license again to get the latest updates (I was initially moderately annoyed that I had to re-up the license for the same major version, but at the same time I've gotten tremendous value out of it, it's not overly expensive, and it's every 3 years). I've tried other editors. I used VS Code for a long while and will still occasionally open a project in it, but all too often it feels a little bloated in comparison.

If I need to work on HTML, JavaScript, JSON, text or any number of files, I can't help but want to open them with Sublime, *especially* large files. I've had VS Code crash trying to read large XML or JSON data dumps. Sublime Text will open them with ease and the JSON plugin will even neatly format them without complaint.

I write this post thinking about the tools we use on a day-to-day basis. So often we're chasing different tools trying to find the "best" one. I have been and still am guilty of struggling at times from sticking with one tool. I see someone using a new IDE or to-do app, or something else and I'm like *ooooo shiny!*. Instead of getting work done, I'm playing around with whatever the tool du jour is.

There are still some projects I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for. TypeScript support for Sublime Text has still been shaky. Most of my current projects don't use TypeScript, but some still do. I've been meaning to try to find a way get better support for it, but more often I just have wanted to get work done rather than fiddle.

At the end of the day, the money I've spent on Sublime Text licenses has felt well spent and for projects like my website, it's more than enough.
