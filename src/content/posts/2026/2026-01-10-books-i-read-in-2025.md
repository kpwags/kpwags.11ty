	This was a scary look at the autocratic world, and how so many of the things happening in America. It's a short book and I'd recommend it. It puts the current situation in the US even more frightening.

	This provided some good insight into McKinsey which made me angrier the more I read. Their callous disregard for how their work affects people is just cruel. It was enlightening and I feel important to understand how much McKinsey and companies like McKinsey cause the harm that they do.

	Another interesting read by Erik Larson. It was interesting reading about Churchill and the challenges he faced with the Blitz. I knew it was bad, but this provided some insight into it and the UK government’s handling of it. The only thing I wasn’t sure of was the sidebars into his family’s love affairs.

	This was an interesting and in depth look at the history of Ukraine as far back as the Greek and Roman Empires. It was written in 2015 so the current war is not included, but the run up to it was. It was captivating and gave me an idea of what Ukraine has been through as well as how we got to where we are today.
