For the last several years, I've written these posts setting some aspirations and goals for the upcoming year. I often set lofty goals for myself. Sometimes I complete them, other times I do not. Still though, I think there's something worthwhile in the exercise of targeting things you'd like to aspire to complete.
<!-- excerpt -->

2025 was a tumultuous year. There was a lot going on and I found it easy to get myself distracted by various goings on in the world. There were days where I found it hard to focus. I think that's one thing I want to focus (get it?) on this year. 

Last year, I started using Raycast's focus sessions. I found it to be incredibly helpful to keep myself focused on writing. It was able to block all social apps and websites on my MacBook when I had my mind wander. I've found the [LeechBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/) browser plugin which I'm hoping will help on Linux. I don't really have many apps on Linux that are likely to distract me outside the web browser. Obviously some times its good to let one's mind wander, but all too often I was letting myself get distracted last year when I didn't want to.

The horrors of 2025 and the likelihood that this is going to continue into the indefinite future also makes me want to think more about all that I am thankful for. It an be easy to get wrapped up in all the awful stuff going on in the world that one can forget about all the blessings they have. I'm no different. I want to try some mindfulness exercises to remember the people and things I am grateful for this year. If nothing else, maybe it can brink some balance to my mental state.

## Aspirations

To continue with the tradition of previous years, I'm going to set five aspirations I'd like to complete this year. I think they're all very much doable.

### Write 350,000 Words

Despite shelving my one novel/novella from the last couple years, I think I'm doing better with writing on a regular basis. I want to target 350,000 words this year. It doesn't matter whether I'm writing a story, a blog post, or anything else, any words count. It ends up being a little less than 1,000 words a day which I think is doable.

### Complete 12 Video Games

I have a backlog of games I want to play. I think I'm going to try this again and target a game a month.

### Read 52 Books

I blew past even this number in 2025, but I would like to keep this going. Targeting a book a week seems reasonable. I generally try to read for about an hour or so every night.

### Run 300 Miles and Bike 300 Miles

I've been wanting to get back into bike riding for a while now. Maybe this is finally the year I get some bike rides in. As for running, 300 miles is a little bit on the low side for my running totals, but with some bike rides mixed in, should be attainable.

### Build Out My Photography Site

This has been [on my mind for a little while now](/posts/2025/12/06/rebuilding-my-photography-site/). I had taken it down a while back and now it's time to bring it back.

### Everything Else

Other things I would like to continue to do are: continue playing the guitar, doodling (I've been trying to do a doodle a day in Procreate on my iPad), be better about my diet, and try to make sure I stay in touch or get back in touch with my friends.

## Here's to 206

Here's to a good 2026. You can view my progress [here](/progress/2026/).
