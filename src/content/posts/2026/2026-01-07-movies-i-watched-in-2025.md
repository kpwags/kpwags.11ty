It was a lighter year for movies in 2025. We watched more TV than movies this year.

	Definitely the best of the prequel trilogy. It did a good job bridging the prequels to set up the original trilogy. Good soundtrack, good action scenes as well.

	title="Star Trek: Section 31"

	I enjoyed this as a sci-fi action movie, but feel it missed the mark as a Star Trek movie. Even still, Michelle Yeoh did a fantastic job as Georgiou.

<media-box
	title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"
	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/"
	image="https://i.postimg.cc/dVVKndSW/star-wars-1.jpg"
	rating="3"

	Still the weakest of all the movies, but not as deserving of all the hate it gets in my opinion. The lightsaber duel choreography is one of the best in Star Wars.

<media-box
	title="Star Wars: The Clone Wars"
	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/"
	image="https://i.postimg.cc/hvtxwKZd/star-wars-clone-wars.jpg"

	I wish I had known to watch this prior to the TV series. It introduced several of the characters we grow to love in the TV series. The story itself felt like it dragged on a bit longer than it needed to.

<media-box
	title="A Walk Among the Tombstones"
	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365907/"

	An enjoyable detective-style thriller. Liam Neeson played the detective well.

	title="The Thursday Murder Club"
	link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12001534/"

	This wasn't bad. It was captivating and Brosnan, Mirren, and Kingsley were enjoyable in their roles.
