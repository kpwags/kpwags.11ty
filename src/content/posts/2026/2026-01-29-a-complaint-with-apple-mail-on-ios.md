For a first-world problem, this is probably pretty up there, but I have a small complaint about Apple Mail.
<!-- excerpt -->

I have three email inboxes on my phone. I keep tabs on each one and generally have a good idea of what senders go to which email address. Every once in a while though, I get a message, normally spam or spam-adjacent that I want to either unsubscribe from or mark as spam. It would be really nice if I could quickly identify from the unified inbox, which email address these emails were sent to. Right now the easiest way I can think of to check is to switch to each email's inbox to see which one it appears in.

It's annoying and I wish Apple would provide an easier way to identify quickly which email inbox a message is in. I used to use AirMail. It had a feature where you could assign each inbox a color. In the unified inbox, there'd be a couple pixel-wide bar to the left of each message indicating the inbox. That'd be a nice feature to have and I wish Apple Mail for iOS had something similar.
