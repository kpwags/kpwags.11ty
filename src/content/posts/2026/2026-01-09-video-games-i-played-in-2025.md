I didn't play as much as I hoped, but still got some in.

	I finally went through and did the single player campaign. It wasn't a bad story, but somewhat predictable. The multiplayer is still fun.

	I still enjoy this 20 years later. I tend to play more classic than the current iteration.

	I enjoyed this. The gameplay reminded me some of Mario RPG and Eldenring. The story was intriguing and captivating. I probably should have played through faster without all the breaks in between.

	I really enjoyed the game. The story was good as well as the gameplay. There's something intensely satisfying about taking your lightsaber to Stormtroopers.

	I only played a few rounds of this, have been meaning to play more but Jedi Survivor and Far Cry captured my focus.

	Some of the story seems a little on the nose today. The gameplay was fun and I enjoyed the open world.

	I'm still playing through this. It's a sequel to Far Cry 5 and I've been having fun with it.
