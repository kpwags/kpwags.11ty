A little while back I was perusing a Reddit thread where someone was trying to figure out the best lifting routine for themselves. They were relatively new to lifting and were going back and forth with others trying to determine the optimum routine. As someone who has bounced around a bit with lifting routines, my primary advice is this: *just start lifting*. The advice is good for exercise, and can also be good for a lot of other things in life.
<!-- excerpt -->

Be it exercising, trying your hand at writing, gardening or any number of other hobbies, sometimes all you have to do is start. Maybe it's going out for a jog to see how far you can go, it could be just opening a word processor and starting to write a short story or an outline to a novel. I could also be just buying a few flower pots, some soil and seeds to have a few plants on a porch or balcony. You don't have to build a massive vegetable garden or run a marathon. 

*Just Start*

I write this as someone who has tried to optimize the way I do things. I'm still guilty of it from time to time, but I try to remember that sometimes, you just have to start. All the planning in the world means nothing if you don't actually do what it is you're planning to do. Planning of course can still be essential, but if all you ever do is plan, what are you *actually* doing?

Get out there, try new things, see where life takes you.
