I’ve been reading [Liar in a Crowded Theater](https://bookshop.org/p/books/liar-in-a-crowded-theater-freedom-of-speech-in-a-world-of-misinformation-jeff-kosseff/19780472?ean=9781421447322) by Jeff Kosseff and he was talking about how some state laws in the early 2000s around speech were written in such a way that did or did not include the Internet. Cases that are super similar, but if done on the internet might not qualify for coverage under the law. It made me think and realize that the Internet is not really that old.
<!-- excerpt -->

Nowadays, the Internet is ubiquitous in our lives, but 30 years ago, it was only in its infancy. I remember getting dialup internet as a teenager and just being amazed by it. I’m only in my early forties, but the early part of my life, the Internet wasn’t a thing. There are adults that have lived their whole lives with access to the internet.

I guess this isn’t really a novel thought, it just struck me last night and I felt like sharing.

As for the laws mentioned above, I’d wager they’ve been updated.
