My week notes for the week of August 10 through August 17.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Finished My Redesign

If you're reading this on my site, you might notice that [it looks a bit different](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/08/23/a-wild-redesign-has-appeared/). Along with my media repository being done, I took advantage of the switch of the media files to also tweak the site. I have a few last things I want to tweak, but that's minor.

## New Leg Pads

I ended up buying new (to me) goalie leg pads for hockey. After taking the puck off the knee (lucky shot, really) I decided a newer pair would be better. I found a pair on Sideline Swap at a good price and now I'm excited to give them a try Monday night.

## Even More Running

The weather this week was amazing...taking advantage, I ran even more this week than last, totaling a little over 19.5 miles. The runs went well and I think the weather really helped allow me to keep a decent pace.

## Figured Out My Water Softener Issues (Finally)

Our water softener hasn't been working for the last year or so. It's been an item on my to-do list for a while to try to fix it. Last year I tried completely emptying it and cleaning the filter. That didn't fix it. Finally, thanks to help from my Dad, we tracked the likely issue to be a clogged exit tube. Sure enough, if I had the water softener expel the water into buckets, it worked properly. After digging up the hose outside, sure enough the hose had snapped and got clogged with dirt. I replaced the hose and sured up the hose connector, ran the water softener through a cycle, and it all seems to be working. Last step will be to empty it and replace the salt, but I *hope*, I found the problem.
