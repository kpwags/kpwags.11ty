My week notes for the week of September 29 through October 5.

## Notes

### Back to the Grind

It was nice to have a week off from the real world and I had a good vacation, but damn it sucks to have to start waking up and going back to work.

### Media Repository Up and Running on my NAS

I was able to finally get my Node and React version up and running on my NAS. It means that I can now use my PC in whatever OS I need and will still have a good place to store what I'm reading, listening, and watching.

## A Weekend in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania

Lauren and I spent the weekend in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania up in the Poconos. We stayed in a hotel right on the main street and were able to walk to different shops, bars, restaurants and breweries. We also ventured out to [Silverback Distillery](https://www.sbdistillery.com) for a tasting. It was a fun weekend.

## The Wonder Years & The Menzingers in Concert

The weekend trip's culminated with a concert. Two of my favorite bands, *The Wonder Years* and *The Menzingers* played a show together and it was amazing.
