My week notes for the week of November 10 to November 16.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Goalie Battle Monday Night

Monday's hockey game felt like kind of a goalie battle. Myself and our opponent's goalie were both shellacked by shots and the game ended in a 1-1 tie. It was a fun game.

### Trying to Write

I set a goal this month to write 30,000 words towards my novel. That sadly has not quite gone the way I had hoped. The US election results and news has really messed with my headspace. I'm getting some writing done, but I'm not sure how much I'll end up writing.

### House Work & Painting

I got the motivation to get back into painting the trim in the main living areas. Right now, all that's left is the trim around the one window in our dining room, and one 10 foot stretch behind furniture in our living room. Hoping to get to that one night this week. After that, the only trim left will be in the bedrooms, which we're okay with for the time being.

Ray's not wrong here. Saquon Barkley has been fun to watch this year, and he's bailed the Eagles out of several games.
