My week notes for the week of May 26 through June 1.

## Revamping My Diet

I got some bloodwork back recently that was a little less than ideal. Nothing awful, but gave me a push to revisit my diet. It hasn’t been bad, but I’ve definitely looked back and have been snacking a little more than I probably should. Going to try to cut back on the snacking and really try to get my caloric intake a little lower to hopefully lose some more weight faster.

## Adventures of a New Fridge

We got a “new to us” refrigerator for our basement. It came with the doors off and some assembly required. No big deal…right? Well I found the manual for it online and got the doors all put back together only to find that we had a piece that we didn’t know where it went. The manual said nothing about it. Plugging the fridge in, it started beeping. Again, the manual said nothing about that. It took searching the number on top of the random part to find out what it was and where it needed to go. Frustrating since it should have been in the manual.

## New Little Personal Project

One of the things I've been trying to do more is make sure I own my media and my data. I decided that I'd build a little tool to keep track of my reading, watching, listening, and playing lists. They're currently stored within my Notion account, but I started a small .NET project to start to manage them locally. I'm building the interface using Blazor and will interact with a Sqlite database using EntityFramework. Still in the early phases, but should be useful.

## Upgraded to Eleventy 3.0

This past weekend I upgraded my site to the latest [Eleventy 3.0 alpha](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/canary-eleventy-v3/). Outside of a typo in an import that took me some time to track down, it went smoothly. I was definitely impressed with the ease of upgrading major versions. I remember having issues upgrading [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), so [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)'s ease was refreshing.
