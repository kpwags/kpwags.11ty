There has been a lot of news lately about both the LA Times and Washington Post [not endorsing either candidate for president](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/25/democracy-dies-in-darkness-helped-along-by-billionaire-cowardice/). Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong might own the Post and LA Times respectively, but I control my site. And Iâ€™m not going to be a rich asshole coward and I ***will*** endorse a candidate for the office of President of the United States. I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President.

In this race, there really is only one candidate who stands for American values and democracy. Kamala Harris is the candidate to lead America forward. She is the obvious choice to ensure the Republic can continue.

Kamala Harris is the better candidate on every issue.

- She supports re-instating *Roe v. Wade* to return the right of women to have control over their own bodies.
- She supports combatting and working to fix climate change rather than ignoring all the scientific evidence and claiming it doesnâ€™t exist.
- She supports tax breaks for the middle class, not the ultra-wealthy.
- She supports union rights and the working class.
- She supports LGBTQ rights.
- She supports democracy, both at home and abroad.
- She wonâ€™t hand Ukraine over to Putin.

I would be proud to call her President.

So please remember to vote for Kamala Harris on Tuesday November 5, 2024.
