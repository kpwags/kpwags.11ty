Week notes for June 9 through June 22. Double edition due to my trip to New York City.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Continued Work on Media Repository

I’ve continued work on my media repository. Links and video games are in working order. Currently working on podcasts. For a simpler project like this, I love how .NET, Blazor, and Entity Framework all work so well together.

## New York City

Wife and I took a trip to New York City to celebrate my birthday. We stayed at the LUMA hotel on 41st street between 6th and Broadway. It was the first time we ever stayed there and chose it since it was right next to Bryant Park. It was nice to grab some coffee and a pastry every morning and sit in the park and read or write.

A lot of the time was spent wandering around the city. We did see *Book of Mormon* one day. We checked out one of Starbucks’ Reserve Roasteries in Chelsea, a bunch of breweries in both Long Island City and Manhattan. Overall it was a good vacation and a good trip.

## Small Utility Created

I ended up building a little .NET console app to create the markdown files with templates for the front matter 11ty needs to build my site. I had been using snippets in VS Code and Sublime, but I decided to get a little fancier. I forget where I got the idea, but it makes things a little simpler.

## Works In Progress Page

I added a [works in progress page](/wips/) to talk about some of the projects I have cooking as well as others that are inactive. I think I got the idea from [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me).
