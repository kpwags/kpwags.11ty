You might have noticed some changes in the look and feel of the site. Over the last month I spent time rebuilding my site to hopefully make it look a little nicer.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had been considering this for a little while, I wanted to improve some of the typography, spacing, and the look and feel.

The impetus to do it now was that I had just finished my media repository and I was going to have to adjust the media pages to pull from the generated JSON rather than the Notion API anyway, so it seemed as good a time as any.

I took advantage of the redesign to clean up older CSS, combine CSS, and remove a lot of code that was either duplicated or extraneous. It was nice to see a bunch of CSS and even some JS files disappear.

## New Features

This wasn't just a redesign in that I gave it a new skin. I also added some additional features to my site in the process.

### Better Dialogs for My Ratings and Thoughts

On my [bookshelf](/bookshelf/), [TV](/tv/), [movies](/movies/), and [video games](/video-games/) pages, there are buttons (assuming you have JS enabled) that pop up a dialog with some additional thoughts I have on the movie, TV show, book, or video game. That's still there, but now I make sure to show a little more in the dialog to make it clear which item the thoughts are tied to.

### Music Albums Now Clickable

You can now click on the albums on the [music](/music/) page to see more info about the album, including my thoughts if I have any of note.

### Filtering

I have added filtering on both my books and video game pages. You can filter the books based on genre as well as fiction/non-fiction. Video games can be filtered by platform, genre, as well as completion status.

## Next Steps

The next steps are mostly simple. Keep writing and adding content. Maybe some tweaks here and there.

Also, if you see anything weird, let me know. Definitely possible I missed something or introduced a bug.
