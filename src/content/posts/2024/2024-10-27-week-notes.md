My week notes for the week of October 20 through 26, 2024.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Accessibility Work at Work

I spent most of my week at work fixing the accessibility issues that got flagged in our internal review. I think I got most of them addressed, but a follow-up review is still forthcoming.

### Beautiful, if Dry, Weather

The weather over the past week has been amazing and it’s allowed me to enjoy evenings sitting out on the porch with my laptop writing or working on my media repository. I’m not sure how long this will last so I plan on taking advantage of it as much as I can. We really could use some rain though.

### Hockey a Mixed Bag

Played two games this week. Tied the first one 2-2 with me in net. Thought the team and I played well, we just couldn’t sneak one more past their goalie, and they got some good tic-tac-toe passes to sneak one past my back side twice. The other game was just a blowout in our opponent’s favor. My sub-par play didn’t help matters. Oh well, shake things off and come back stronger next games.

### Used Book Stores are Dangerous

Saturday my wife and I went to our local used book store. That was probably our first “mistake” of the day as I walked out with more than I intended to purchase. Oh well, I’ll read them.

A good reminder that going independent is not always the end-all-be-all we sometimes think it can be. I appreciate Molly’s writing and would highly recommend subscribing to her work, as well as other independent writers if you are able.

If you have a good grasp and understanding of HTML and CSS, the rest can fall into place.

It’s often amazing to hear about how much goes into making the C# language. It’s one of my primary languages and it really is impressive all the work the team at Microsoft puts in to make sure that everything continues to work as they advance the language.
