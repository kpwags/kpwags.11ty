I try to keep myself informed and apprised about what is going on in the world. I feel it’s important to be aware of the news and whatnot. The downside of this is that it oftentimes leaves me stressed out, angry, and anxious about the state of the world. Lately I’ve been struggling with not devolving into a state of perpetual despair.
<!-- excerpt -->

For those in the US, the news lately has not been great. The Supreme Court has determined that the President is now a King. They also drastically curtailed the ability of our regulators to actually do their job and regulate. And that’s just the latest in a long line of bad news items.

I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve removed some social media from my phone, signed off of it on my desktop and have tried to “disconnect” from the firehose. 

I’m really not sure what the answer to all of this is though. I can’t just close my eyes and ears and ignore the world. It’s important that I stay informed with what’s going on in the world, but I’m generally happier when I’m not thinking about it.

I guess this is just one post of I don’t know what to do.
