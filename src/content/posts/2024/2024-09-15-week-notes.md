My week notes for the week of September 8 through September 14.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Progress on Media Repository

I've been making great progress on building out my media repository in Node.js and React. Books are almost done, and all that'll be left after that will be my music. I'm happy with how it's going, how it's working, and where things are. It's mostly just a direct copy of the Blazor version, but with some niceties added.

## Running

I've been running every day this month. I've run at least 3.25 miles every day this month, and this past week is no different. What started as taking advantage of some good weather, and then continued as an excuse to skip legs day at the gym has now turned into a 2-week running streak combined with 24 runs in the last 26 days. I'm running more and it's feeling good.

I did finally do that legs day at the gym Friday and felt it heavily for today's run. My legs are sore and it wasn't even that heavy a day...just the first in a long while...so ow!

## Hockey Season Starts Anew

Tuesday was my hockey team's Fall/Winter season opener. We won 5-2, played a solid team game, and I even tallied 2 goals. Which is weird since I was playing defense. I'm still happy about it though, especially with the win to back it up. I did struggle at the position as I'm more comfortable at wing when I skate out. I got caught flat footed a few too many times, but thankfully my defensive partner and our goalie were able to bail me out.
