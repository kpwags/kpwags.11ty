My week notes for the week of July 14 through July 20.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Media Repository Work

I spent a lot of evenings this week working hard on my media repository. I'm just about done with it. I got a lot of the data loaded into it as well. The next step will be one of the more tedious parts. I'm going to have to go through and add a bunch of the data to the items that wasn't stored in Notion. I've developed some ideas for improvements for my site that requires data that wasn't stored in Notion. I've built the functionality to store it in my media repository, but now I need to add it.

## Running Again

After 2 weeks of temperatures in the 90s, they've dropped to the low 80s and I've taken the brief respite to go on some runs. It's still hot which might be contributing to my inability to keep my heart rate down, but I'm still happy to be getting some cardio in.

## Ratchet & Clank

I've been playing through *Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart* and have been enjoying it. It's my first foray into the series and the good words I've heard about it so far have been true. It's a fun game and so far I'd recommend it.
