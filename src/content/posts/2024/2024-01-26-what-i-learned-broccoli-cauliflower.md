This year I want to try more things in the kitchen. Try new recipes, new styles, and expand my cooking abilities. At the same time, my wife and I found [Good Eats](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/good-eats) on HBO Max and have been going through and watching it.
<!-- excerpt -->

It’s an interesting show talking about different foods, their history, and of course recipes and how to cook them. One of the episodes we watched this week was on cabbage, and the bad rap it sometimes gets. At the beginning of the episode, Alton was talking about the different types of cabbages and it was brought up that both [Broccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli) and [Cauliflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower) are types of cabbages likely first cultivated in Italy.

I’m not entirely sure why that made me go “huh!”, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. I’ve been eating more broccoli lately and have been finding some cauliflower recipes I want to try, and this factoid just sort of plopped down in my lap.
