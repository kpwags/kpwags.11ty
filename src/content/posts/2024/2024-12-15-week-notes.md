My week notes for the week of December 8 - December 14.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Hockey Playoff Elimination

Monday night I had my worst game in net all season and we were eliminated in the semi-finals. Feels bad, but gotta bounce back for the consolation round Monday.

### Furniture Shopping is an Adventure

We're still trying to figure out what we want for our next couch and living room. After doing some searching, we found that the quality of furniture we'd get from 2 out of 3 of the first places we looked at would probably not exactly be all that great. We looked at other places and found some pieces we liked that had good reviews, but a much higher price point. We'll need to figure out how to balance price and longevity...especially since pets will likely be coming into the picture at some point.

### Using Linux Again

I recently booted up my LinuxMint partition on my desktop and am using it more. It's been a long while since I've used anything other than MacOS as my primary driver at home and am curious as to how Linux fares nowadays as a primary desktop OS.

### New Computer Development Blues

I mentioned how last week my work laptop got bricked by the Windows 11 upgrade. This week I ran into [compatibility issues with .NET 9 and the database project within it](https://hachyderm.io/@kpwags/113645859673980518). Mastodon helpfully saved the day and I was able to get the `global.json` file to be recognized to force VisualStudio and Rider to use .NET 8 instead.

It's crazy to think we're still getting data from the Voyager probes, and that same data can be revisited to find even more insights and information.

We already know that streaming isn't really good for most artists and musicians. More reason to buy music and go to shows to support the bands you love.
