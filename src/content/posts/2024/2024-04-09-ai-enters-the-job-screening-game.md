I was recently listening to the [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org) podcast and they had an article about those annoying pre-employment personality screening some companies put their candidates through. Now [Artificial Intelligence is getting involved](https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/08/tech-is-supercharging-pre-employment-personality-tests/). Hoo boy I have thoughts.

It’s been a little while since I’ve been on the hunt for a job and as I’m sure many can relate, it’s a soul sucking process. All the rejections, all the hoops that we often have to jump through for the different applications, it’s incredibly stressful. Now companies are adding more personality tests to make it even more aggravating.

I get that it can be difficult and expensive for companies to hire the right candidate, but ugh, why do some have to make the process even more maddening.
