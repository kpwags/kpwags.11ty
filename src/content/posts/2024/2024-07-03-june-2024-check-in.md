I can‚Äôt believe the year is already half over. But whether I believe it is or not makes no difference. The highlight of June was my birthday trip to New York City.
<!-- excerpt -->

## New York City

For my birthday, my wife and I continued the tradition of spending it in New York City. We changed it up a little bit by staying in a new hotel. We stayed at [LUMA](https://www.lumahotels.com/times-square) on 41st Street. The hotel was nice. We chose it because rooms come with a little sitting area which was just nice when we needed to rest a bit between activities. The primary reason for the change though was to put us closer to Bryant Park. We spent most mornings getting up, grabbing coffee and a pastry and sitting in the park reading or writing. It was just a nice way to charge up and start the day. Even when the heat wave hit on our last 2-3 days, Bryant Park wasn‚Äôt too bad early in the morning in the shade.

The rest of the trip was fun. We seldom go to NYC with any real plan. Most of the time it‚Äôs just walk around and see what we find. This trip, the highlights ended up being:

- Seeing *Book of Mormon*, which was raunchy and funny. 
- Visited the [Starbuck Roastery](https://www.starbucksreserve.com/locations/new-york-roastery) in Chelsea. Was kind of cool to see some of their roasting process.
- Checked out a number of breweries in both Long Island City and Manhattan
  - [Fifth Hammer](https://www.fifthhammerbrewing.com)
  - [Focal Point](https://www.focalpoint.beer)
  - [Talea](https://www.taleabeer.com)
  - [Other Half](https://otherhalfbrewing.com/location/rockefeller-center/)

## Fitness

I‚Äôve made a concerted effort to eat healthier this month and the scale is starting to show it. I‚Äôve put the effort to building in some runs, lifting more, and even found a nice day weather-wise to go for a bike ride.

The heat wave towards the end of the month got me lifting more, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. Going outside to run would just make myself miserable. I‚Äôm hoping to start dragging myself out of bed earlier to maybe get some morning pre-work runs in since it‚Äôs only going to get hotter as summer really starts to sink in over the next 2 months.

## Media Repository

I‚Äôve been hard at work on building my media repository in Blazor. I‚Äôve gotten the management movies, video games, links, & podcasts all built. Still need to find a good way to import the data from Notion, but I can figure that out later. I still have some open questions on how I want to handle the completed project, but I can cross that bridge when I get there.

I do plan on sharing the code once complete. I don‚Äôt see myself customizing this to make it usable for others as I‚Äôm building it only for myself, but if the code can help someone build a solution for themselves faster, they would be welcome to reference it or fork it.

## Site Updates

I‚Äôve done some small tweaks to my site. I‚Äôve added pinned posts, a [works in progress page](https://kpwags.com/wips/), added music & movies to my [now page](https://kpwags.com/now/), and added a WebC component for social media embeds.
