January was a pretty lousy month for me. I started the month having to say goodbye to my cat, Cookie. And to be honest, the sting of that continued on for the rest of the month.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Cookie

{% image "./images/cookie3.jpg", "Cookie sitting next to me on the couch" %}

I had Cookie almost my entire adult life. I got her 2 years after I graduated college and she‚Äôs been by my side ever since. Having to say goodbye to her was a real kick in the gut, especially since I didn‚Äôt see it coming. When I lost my previous cat, Nibbler, and dog Otto, I knew there was a good chance it was coming prior to the worst news. With Cookie, it was sudden. I took her in for what I thought was digestive system issues, but quickly found out a tumor had reduced her lung capacity to 25% of what it should be. I was obviously devastated and after talking it over with my wife and the vet, we made the tough decision to say goodbye. [I miss her](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/01/10/remembering-cookie/).

Unfortunately, it left a bad taste in my mouth that obviously still stings and made the rest of the month feel kind of bleh.

## Work

Work has been going well. I was finally able to finish up the one feature on one project that had been in development since August or so. It was nice to finish that up and get it out the door.

My next big project is just about to be ready for development and I‚Äôm excited to get started on it. I‚Äôm not sure what I can really say without getting in trouble, but it‚Äôs a fairly large project and should be a real challenge which I‚Äôm looking forward to.

## Side Projects

I wrote about [limiting what I work on as a side project](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/01/25/limiting-my-side-projects/). I haven‚Äôt made up my mind exactly which project I‚Äôm going to tackle, but I‚Äôve been delving into the new .NET 8 Blazor web app and am seeing what‚Äôs changed since I last worked with it. The separate Blazor WASM vs Blazor Server has morphed into a hybrid model that I‚Äôm still wrapping my head around.
