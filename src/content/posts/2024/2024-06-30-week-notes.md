My week notes for the week of June 23 through June 29.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Back to the Grind

After being on vacation the week before, I had to get back used to early wake ups again. Thankfully it was generally a calm week which gave me a good chance to get back into the swing of things.

## Hockey League Starting Back Up

The Instructional League (I-League) I play goalie in started up while I was in New York City. This was the first week I played which means I’m now going to be back to playing 2, occasionally 3 days a week. It’s good exercise and fun. When I have to do the back-to-back games though, I definitely feel my age.

## Wait Wait...Don’t Tell Me!

On Thursday, we went to a live taping of [Wait Wait...Don’t Tell Me](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me). For anyone not familiar, it is a weekly news quiz from NPR with plenty of jokes and laughs. It was our 5th time seeing the show live and it continues to be a good time. The podcast is great, but it’s interesting how much more there is in the show when it’s recorded live.

## House Work Never Ends

I started working of freshening up the trim in our house. It really just needs some sanding and a fresh coat of paint. Part of the thinking is that at some point my wife and I will adopt new pets. It will be far easier to paint now than wait until we have pets and then find some way to not have the wet paint ruined and many dog and cat baths.
