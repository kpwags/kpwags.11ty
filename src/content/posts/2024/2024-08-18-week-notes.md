My week notes for the week of August 10 through August 17.
<!-- excerpt -->

## End of the Hockey Season

The hockey team I captain was sadly eliminated in the playoffs in a tight 4-3 loss. Was definitely a good, fun season, but a disappointing end. Oh well, next season starts mid-September.

## Media Repository Up & Running

I got my media repository up and running on my Linux Mint desktop. I can easily access it within my home network which is what I’m going for. It’d be nice to have more global reach, I’m home most of the time and it saves me from having to add authentication to the app.

I’ll need to re-jigger the JSON generator to support it, and I do want to revamp the UI. To start, I just wanted a working system, and I was able to get it up and running quickly with the thought of going back in later and improving it.

## Lots of Running

I was in the mood to run this week, ended up running a little over 17.5 miles. The runs went well and I felt like I was able to generally keep a decent pace.

## Website Redesign

I've made fantastic work on my website redesign. I have all the major pages rebuilt, and am now just going through some final cleanup. It'll be nice to have it done to limit the differences between the two versions. The new version runs completely off my media repository while the current version still runs off Notion. The build time difference is extreme and I'm looking forward to the quicker builds working off the pre-built JSON.
