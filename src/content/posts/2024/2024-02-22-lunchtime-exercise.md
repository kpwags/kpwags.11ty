One of the things I enjoy about working from home, is the ability to exercise a bit over lunch. On nicer days, I'll take a walk or go for a run.

## Health Benefits

I work as a software developer. It means I'm often sitting down for long stretches of time. I don't think I need to elaborate on the idea that it's not always the most healthy thing. I'll get up and move around a bit every hour or so, but I doubt that counts for much.

Getting out, breathing some fresh air and getting exercise hopefully helps with keeping me healthy and counteracting some of the negatives of the long periods of sitting on my ass.

## Mental Health & Mood Benefits

The one thing I actually really like about these walks and runs is the mental health portion. I often find getting some exercise helps break up the day and puts me in a better mood for the afternoon. It often alleviates stress and gives me a new outlook on whatever it is I happen to be working on. I sometimes even figure out solutions to problems I've been having on those walks.

If you have the ability to take a break for a walk or some exercise during the day, I'd recommend it. I haven't always had this ability, and I'd have a hard time saying goodbye to it if the ability goes away.
