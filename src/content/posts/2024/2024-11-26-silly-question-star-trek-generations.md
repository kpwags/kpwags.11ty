So here's a silly question, in the movie Star Trek: Generations, the Enterprise D crashes onto the planet Veridian III. The movie mentions that its neighboring planet, Veridian IV had a pre-warp civilization. It made me wonder something.
<!-- excerpt -->

If Earth was Veridian IV, and Mars was Veridian III, would we be able to detect it from Earth or could our orbiting telescopes? Obviously our Mars orbiters and Rovers could, but I don't know if any of our observatories on or around Earth could. I would suspect not, but I've been surprised by human ingenuity and our technical capabilities before.

It's a silly question, but it makes me curious.
