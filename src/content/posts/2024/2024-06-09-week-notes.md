Week notes for June 2 through June 8.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Really Bumping Up My Running Distance

Since I discovered that I felt better keeping my heart rate in zone 2, I’ve been able to run farther. I’ve added more 4 mile runs, and have even crossed the 6 mile mark.

## Re-Organizing Content for Site

When I first built my site in 11ty, I didn’t realize how easy it was to define permalinks. Because of this, I built out paths manually. I’ve spent part of this week correcting that and organizing my content files better. It’s not difficult, but it’s tedious.

## Back on the Bike

I ended up going for my first bike ride in around a year. Managed a little over 27 miles on the Schuylkill River Trail. It was a beautiful day for it and I hope it won’t be the last this year.

## Progress on Media Repository

I spent some time working on my media repository and was able to get the links content functionality built out. Now all that’s left is populating it. I need to figure out a good way to load everything in to the various tables...hundreds of records would be annoying as all get out to backfill manually.
