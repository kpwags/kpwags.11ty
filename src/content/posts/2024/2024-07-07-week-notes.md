My week notes for the week of June 30 through July 6.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Short Work Week

Thanks to the Fourth of July holiday, I only had a 3-day work week. It was a nice change of pace to have a 4-day weekend. Work wasn’t too bad. I ended up finishing the initial version of the project I was using Blazor on. For the first time in a long while, I jumped back into React and TypeScript.

## Mass Effect 3

This year I’ve been playing through the original Mass Effect trilogy. I plowed through Mass Effect pretty quickly. Mass Effect 2 and 3 have taken more time due to what feels like a lot more content. Despite its shaky start, Mass Effect 2 was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. Mass Effect 3 has been good so far as well. It’s interesting how they’ve built so much into the game and how decisions you make in all the games can come back and affect what options you have as you progress.

## Heat Wave Hell

The last several days have all been in the 90s with high humidity. Needless to say, it hasn’t felt pleasant. It has put a damper on my exercise, limiting me to strength training. I wanted to go for some runs, but I’d be more likely to have health issues trying to run in this. I’d say maybe it’ll cool down soon, but it’s July...

## Media Repository

I’ve been plugging away on the media repository. I was able to finish up the TV section. The funny part is that I’ve been improving things as I move along and will have to go back and apply the improvements to the other sections I’ve already finished. Such is the way I guess.
