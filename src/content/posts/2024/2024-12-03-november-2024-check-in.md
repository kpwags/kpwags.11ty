Well this month started out great with a nice long weekend in Cape May, but then we had to go and elect a fascist to the highest office and it took a quick nosedive from there.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Cape May, New Jersey

Lauren had a cross-stitch retreat in Cape May, NJ at the beginning of the month, so we made a long weekend out of it. We stayed at Congress Hall which was amazing as it always is.

I spent some of the time I was alone walking around Cape May with my camera, sat out on the hotel's veranda enjoying the nice weather, and relaxing in general. The days after the retreat, Lauren and I ventured out to the local wineries and breweries. We also had a nice (late) anniversary dinner at The Ebbitt Room which is a fantastic restaurant in the heart of Cape May.

## Writing

I wanted to hit 30,000 words this month and was doing well. Unfortunately the election of Mango Mussolini threw my mind for a loop and I had a hard time focusing on writing. I'm still trying to figure my thoughts out (other than the obvious disappointment, terror, and numbness). I did hit almost 12,000 words, so I guess that's something.

## Fascism Comes to America

I was hoping we could to avoid this, but alas. I don't really have much more to say about this now other than this is bad.

## Media Repository Rewrite

I have made some pretty good progress on the rewrite of the frontend. React is gone, it feels faster and the download size is smaller. But more importantly I'm getting back to the basics and the bones of the web. I can still respect what libraries like React can accomplish, but it's nice to focus on the basics.
