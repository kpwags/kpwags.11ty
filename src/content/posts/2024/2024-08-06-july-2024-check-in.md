I heard on a podcast the other day that you know you’re getting older when the months start to fly by. I kind of get that after realizing that it’s August already.

## Spending Time on My Gaming Backlog

I’ve spent a fair amount of time playing video games. I was able to finish up the *Mass Effect Trilogy*. After many starts and stops over the years, I was able to finally go through and play the three games. Overall I enjoyed the series. I was a little saddened by the ending, but I also felt like it was fitting for how the story went. I did end up watching some YouTube videos of the different endings since so much of what happens is triggered by your actions across the various games.

## Finishing Up My Media Repository

I was able to get pretty close to finishing up my media repository. I have the initial version ready and working. I need to figure out how to get it running on my NAS as I believe it is possible and would be the way to go. The storage and retrieval is good to go though.

## Blog Redesign

I’ve been toying with the idea of giving my site a refresh. When I converted my site over to 11ty, I limited the design tweaks to make the switch as quick as possible. I‘m using the switch to my media repository as an excuse to update the look and feel of my site.

## Fitness

Due to the multiple heat waves keeping temperatures in the mid to high 90s, my ability to run was limited. Instead I took the time to focus on my lifting routine. I was happily able to get through the latest 4-week cycle of my 5/3/1 program and nailing all my lifts to bump up my training maxes.
