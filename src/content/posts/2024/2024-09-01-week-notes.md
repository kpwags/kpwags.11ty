My week notes for the week of August 25 through August 31.
<!-- excerpt -->

## House Work

It's Labor Day weekend here in the US and I'm spending part of the long weekend taking care of house projects. I was able to clean out and restart the water softener, and started painting the baseboards in the living room. We figure we'll open our house and heart to pets again, and it'll be easier to paint now than later.

## Conversion to Node.js & React

After not being able to get my .NET/Blazor media repository running on my NAS, I started converting my media repository over to Node.js & React. I'm pretty sure Node is supported as I was able to get it installed. I'll have to get an MVP up and running quickly to prove it.

I originally wanted to build it using web components, but I opted to push that to the next version. To free up my desktop and make it easier to do some PC gaming, I want to get the next version built ASAP. Once it's up and running, then I'll worry about stripping out React. It's not ideal, but oh well.
