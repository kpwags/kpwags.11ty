October was a busy month for us. It really seemed like we had something going on just about every weekend.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Stroudsburg

The first weekend of the month was spent up in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania for a *The Wonder Years* & *Menzingers* concert. I‚Äôve been wanting to see *The Wonder Years* for a very long time, and was finally able to see them live. I love their music. What made the show even better was that I was also able to see *The Menzingers*, also one of my favorite bands, and funnily enough, the band I‚Äôve seen live the most. Either way the show was awesome and I‚Äôm glad we made it up there.

We decided to make it a full weekend too. Stroudsburg has a cute main street with lots of little shops, restaurants, breweries, wineries and is walkable. We also ventured out to a [local distillery](https://www.sbdistillery.com).

## Phantoms Home Opener

The second weekend was the Lehigh Valley Phantoms home opener up in Allentown. The game was kind of frustrating as a fan of the Phantoms, but odd in its own way. It really felt like the Phantoms were outmatched and constantly playing in their own zone. Oddly enough though, the final shot total was 49-25 in favor of the Phantoms. They almost doubled the shot total of the Hartford Wolf Pack. Despite shots not counting for all that much in the result of the game, they did win 4-3 in the shootout. It was still a fun night.

## Anniversary Weekend

The following weekend was my wife‚Äôs an my 11th anniversary. We celebrated by going into Phoenixville and getting some drinks, snacks, and then dinner at the local distilleries and breweries. It was a low-key day which is what we were both looking for.

## Working on Media Repository

This month I‚Äôve been spending a good amount of time working on my media repository‚Äôs frontend. I‚Äôm starting from scratch, ripping out React and going with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript, with minimal dependencies. It‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt done in a long while and I‚Äôm here for it. I‚Äôm dipping my toes into web components when they make sense. Parts of them do, but I haven‚Äôt had to deal with a lot of complications yet. Either way, it will add more tools to my toolbox.

## Back into Lifting

One thing I haven‚Äôt done much of over the last few months is strength training. I‚Äôve been spending more of my time running, which is good in its own right, but I figured it was time to hit the weights again. I ended up restarting the cycle I was on in my 5/3/1 program, dropping the weights slightly, and starting over. I feel a little weaker, but I‚Äôll pick it back up I‚Äôm sure.
