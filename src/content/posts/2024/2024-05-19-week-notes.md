Notes for the week of May 12 through May 18
<!-- excerpt -->

## Working on Rebuilding My Photography Site

A while back, when upgrading Next.js on my previous site, I was having issues with my photography pages. I decided that I’d shelve the pages and re-introduce them later. Time passed and I never did. This week, I decided to rebuild it as a subdomain instead. I started laying out the page and figuring things out. Will be built with 11ty as well.

## Finding a Lightroom Replacement

For the longest time, I’ve used Adobe Lightroom to manage my photography library. I decided to quit the subscription for it because I want a non-subscription option. I tried my old Lightroom 5 license, but the app is so old, it’s buggy on new Mac hardware. Still trying [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), but it feels a bit clunky.

## Continuing Mass Effect 2

I’ve been spending a lot of time in Mass Effect 2. The game feels so much larger than the original. I’ve been enjoying it. I thought I enjoyed Mass Effect more, but I think that’s changed.

## PWHL Playoffs

I’ve been trying to follow the PWHL playoffs. A lot of games with multiple overtimes. It’s nice to see a women’s hockey league having some success. Hope this continues.

## New Split Keyboard

I recently picked up the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) mechanical ergonomic keyboard. I can't get over how small it is. It does take some getting used to compared to my [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). Also, I could thankfully remap some of the keys because the default layout was opposite the Moonlander and it was nice to be able to set it up to match.
