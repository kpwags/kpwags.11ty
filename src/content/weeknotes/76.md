It was the week of Thanksgiving. It might've been a shorter week at work, but it was a busy weekend at home.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Thanksgiving

It's Thanksgiving in the US and that means family and a large dinner. We ended up hosting my in-laws for dinner. It was busy, but we were still able to have a mostly relaxing time with them. Sitting down afterwards felt good though.

## Black Friday Tradition

One of the things my wife and I have been doing over the last several years has been going to [Bluebird Distilling's](https://www.bluebirddistilling.com) Black Friday launches. Every Black Friday, they release some new limited spirits and this year was no different. This year I wanted to get their 10 year bourbon and their 10 year rye. I'm looking forward to giving each a taste. It was another fun morning, enjoying some special seasonal cocktails and a nice way to start the holiday season.

## Finished Good Eats

My wife and I have been watching [Good Eats](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344651/) sporadically over the last year or so. I've enjoyed it, we've found some good recipes, kitchen tips and tricks, and learned plenty about food history and the science behind foods and recipes. Sadly, we've gone through all the episodes. I really liked how Alton Brown made everything accessible and understandable. Maybe he'll reboot the show at some point, but it's sad to see it over.

## Gaming

I ended up finishing [Jedi: Survivor](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor). I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story and the gameplay. It was a fitting sequel to [Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-fallen-order).

I decided to go with [Far Cry 5](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/far-cry/far-cry-5) as my next game. I had started it several years ago but got distracted by something. Some of it feels a little too close to home given some of the politics here in America. Part of me also chose it since it was recently [announced that Rob Mac & Noah Hawley are creating a TV series on the series.](https://www.polygon.com/far-cry-tv-series-hulu-alien-earth/).

## Cooking

### Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs

We had found some boneless short ribs reduced in price at Wegmans and found what looked like a good [recipe](https://simplymadeeats.com/7900/oven-baked-boneless-beef-short-ribs/) for them. The short ribs were tender and turned out really well. We had them with some fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes. It ended up working out too because the leftovers were my Thanksgiving dinner.
