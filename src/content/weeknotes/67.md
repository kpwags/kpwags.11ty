My week notes for the week of September 7 through September 13.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Fall/Winter Hockey Season Starting

The offseason is over, the fall/winter season has begun. We had our first game of the season. I ended up playing in net, and sadly it didn't go particularly well. I let in a few soft ones and we lost 5-3. Oh well, it's an 18 game season, will work to bounce back next game.

## Enjoying the Beautiful Weather

This week ended up having some really nice weather and I took advantage by sitting out on the porch as much as possible. I wrote a lot and just enjoyed the brisk weather. Feels like fall is coming a little early before the temperature started warming again.

## Getting My Strength Back

I've been doing a good job of staying in my lifting routine and I'm slowly seeing my strength come back. Part of it might be me resetting the weights I'm lifting a little on the low side, but I'm starting to see the numbers rise to numbers that feel a little more similar to where I was in the past.
