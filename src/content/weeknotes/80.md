It was a busy week with Christmas and all, but I'm glad the worst of the holidays are over.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Far Cry 5

I ended up completing [Far Cry 5](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/far-cry/far-cry-5). I had heard hints of the ending, but was still a little surprised with how it ended. I ended up starting it's sequel, [Far Cry New Dawn](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/far-cry/new-dawn). I enjoyed Far Cry 5 and am enjoying New Dawn so far.

## Christmas

Christmas was mostly non-stop. Morning with the in-laws and then dinner with my family. I was so happy to be crashed out on the couch at the end of the day. It wasn't a bad day, just busy. I now have a much better appreciation for my parents when I was young.

## Ice Storm

Friday night into Saturday we had a lot of freezing rain or sleet. I was kind of hoping for snow as it's easier to deal with. I'm now left with an icy driveway that will take a lot of smashing to clear. I'm hoping the above freezing weather will take care of it for me.
