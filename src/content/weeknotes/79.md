It's the final week before Christmas. Thankfully I'm all set, so the next week should hopefully be mostly stress-free.

## I-League Season Over

Monday was the final I-League game of the season. Unfortunately I did not play particularly well and we lost 6-5. Oh well, it was still a fun season.

The instructional sessions start right after the new year and the next season will begin in mid-February or so.

## Eric Mintel Quartet Concert

On Wednesday, my wife and I went to a local bar for a Christmas jazz concert. [Eric Mintel Quartet](https://ericmintelquartet.com/) was playing at [118 North](https://118northwayne.com/) Christmas songs. Some of the songs were originals, but they also played the Charlie Brown Christmas Special. It was a nice evening with good music. They were really impressive.

## Phantoms Teddy Bear Toss Game

Saturday was the annual Lehigh Valley Phantoms teddy bear toss game. Many minor league teams have yearly games where they collect stuffed animals for charity. Whenever the home team scores their first goal, everyone throws their stuffed animals they brought onto the ice. It's fun to watch and experience and it's for charity so it's a great time.

We made an evening of it. We went to Fegley Brew Works across the street from the arena for dinner and drinks, and then to the game to cheer on the Phantoms. The game was fun. We got to throw the teddy bears shortly after the start of the 2nd period, and the Phantoms went on to win 2-1 in the shootout.
