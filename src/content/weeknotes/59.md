My week notes for the week of July 13 through July 19.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Tournaments & More Hockey

The tournament finished Sunday. We ended up finishing 2-2 and in 3rd place, which was unfortunately not enough to go to the championship game for our division. It was still a lot of fun.

The 4 games in 3 days was followed by a game Monday and a game Tuesday. I unfortunately pulled my groin making a save Monday, tried to play Tuesday and made it worse. It mostly healed by the weekend, but Wednesday and Thursday were not much fun.

### Writing More

I mentioned before that I'm dedicating 30 minutes a day to writing. Whether it's towards a blog post, my novel, or anything else, I've been doing a good job sitting down and doing just that. I turn on focus mode in Raycast, set the timer for 30-60 minutes, and write. I have a few blog post ideas started out as well as several thousand more words down on my novel.

  I love this. It would be nice if it could work without JavaScript, but a small price to pay.

  While I'm not necessarily against the use of React, there are probably better options for many new projects. Mario goes through some of the stranger decisions React has made.
