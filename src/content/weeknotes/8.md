My week notes for the week of July 7 through July 13.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Continuing Back-To-Back Hockey Games

In the one hockey league I play in, I play goalie. For anyone not familiar with hockey, it is a specialized position. The gear tends to be more expensive than the gear you wear when you’re skating out as a forward or defenseman. Because of this, the position tends to be in relatively high demand due to the lower supply of available goalies. Well, due to some injuries and vacations, the last three weeks have had me playing back-to-back hockey games. Once for my team, and then right after for another team, filling in for their net minder. I don’t mind because it’s fun and good exercise, but man does it feel good to sit down and take off my gear after that second game.

## Completed Mass Effect 3

I completed [Mass Effect 3](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect) on Thursday. The ending was fitting, but I'm kind of sad by it. I have to admit that I did look afterwards at the different possibilities and I was pretty far off from the ending I would have preferred. It is pretty cool though how the decisions you made in the prior game can come back to either help or hurt you. Either way, it was an enjoyable trilogy.

It was the fourth game I completed this year. [Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/) is up next.

## Battlefield Tattoo Expo

On Saturday I drove out to Gettysburg for the [Battlefield Tattoo Expo](https://battlefieldtattooexpo.com). [Ken Bryan](https://www.facebook.com/IntimateBodyArtStudios/), the artist who did my [sleeve](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/04/29/my-space-sleeve-is-complete/) wanted to enter me in the tattoo contest. Sadly I didn't win anything, but there were some fantastic pieces so I still don't really count it as a loss per say. Either way, it was a fun experience to walk around and see all the various artists and tattoos.
