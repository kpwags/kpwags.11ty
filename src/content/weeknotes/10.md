My week notes for the week of July 21 through July 27.
<!-- excerpt -->

## More Back-to-Back Hockey

I ended up playing 3 games in 2 days Sunday and Monday. Played Sunday night as a skater, then 2 games Monday as a goalie. Played kind of lousy Sunday and lost. Monday's games I thought I played well, but I got hammered with shots and unfortunately couldn't keep them all out. Oh well, I still mostly had fun and got some good exercise in, which is my primary reason for playing.

## Adventures in Docker

I'm just about finished with my media repository and I'm hoping to run it locally on my Synology NAS. Docker seems to be the best way to handle go about doing that. The downside is that I have very little knowledge of Docker outside of running a few pre-built image/containers at work. I'm slowly changing that now to hopefully get this thing up and running. I'm still trying to figure out how to get docker running on my NAS.

## Artemis Lego

I think there are a lot of issues with NASA's SLS and Artemis program, but damn it does look cool. I recently found that there's a Lego set for it, so of course I had to buy it and then build it.

## Re-Organizing My Notes

I spent a little bit of time this week re-organizing my Obsidian folder using the [Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com). I'm not entirely sure I'm doing it 100% correctly, but I do appreciate some of the principles.
