My week notes for the week of April 20 through April 26.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Oblivion Remastered

This week Bethesda announced, and then released a remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I didn't play this nearly as much as Skyrim, but figured I'd been considering a play through of Skyrim so I'd start with Oblivion. Sadly, my video card seems to be struggling to play it. I'm going to have to start looking into a replacement it seems as to be fair, my video card is 5+ years old (probably closer to 7-8). I'm looking for a solid card, but not top of the line. Suggestions are welcome.

### Seasonal Allergy Hell

I have seasonal allergies, and right now it's prime allergy season. I'm not a fan. Pollen, pollen everywhere. It's also been made less pleasant by the fact that it's now lawn mowing season. I had to mow the lawn on Wednesday which kicked up even more pollen. It just sucks because I love being outside in weather like we've been having.
