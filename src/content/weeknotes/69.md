My week notes for the week of September 21 through September 27.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Hard Fought Hockey Win

There's a team in my division in hockey that always seems to have our number. For whatever reason, they're able to stymie us, slow us down, and limit our offense. Even when we're otherwise playing well, they just always manage to squeak past us. Well, we played them again Thursday and this time we managed to squeak past them, winning 3-2. It was a fun, evenly matched game.

## Back Feeling Better

After tweaking my back last week on my final set of squats (still not sure what happened as I did it lifting the bar off the rack an inch or two in preparation to squat), I was able to feel confident to get back to lifting. The session went well, felt a little weaker than usual, but hit all my sets.

## The Menzingers Concert

My wife and I traveled up to Asbury Park, New Jersey to see The Menzingers play at the Stone Pony Summer Stage. We had never been to Asbury Park, or the Stone Pony so it was a first for us. I had heard plenty about it and the outdoor stage was a great place for a concert. The weather was cloudy and it started to rain towards the end of the show, but it was still a great time.
