My week notes for the week of April 27 through May 3.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Spring Cleaning, Outdoor Edition

Every spring since my wife and I bought our house there are various tasks that need doing outside. Some I do every year like spreading mulch around our little flower gardens. Others I mean and want to do, but never get around to it. This week I've started some of the tasks. It definitely makes the house looks nicer from the curb, but my allergies aren't happy with me.

### Too Early to Be this Hot

Friday & Saturday had temperatures in the 80s. It's barely May so I'm not ready for this. I want my springtime weather, allergies and all.

  I appreciate when companies support this kind of development. Fans clearly love their games enough to pour the effort into them, It's nice to see companies support that rather than tie up the courts.
