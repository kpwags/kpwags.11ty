My week notes for the week of February 16 through February 22.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Hockey League Starting Up

One of my hockey leagues (the one I play goalie in) started up Monday. We ended up losing 7-4. I didn't have a particularly good game, but there's still plenty of season left.

### Preventative Care is Important

I ended up getting a colonoscopy this week. The prep for it was not fun, but preventative care is important. Better to catch issues before they become an actual issue. Take care of yourself.

I enjoy the James Bond franchise and am not looking forward to Amazon and Bezos over-saturating the franchise.

I'm generally not a fan of Tailwind, but I also recognize that it can be useful. This is a good writeup of the trade-offs you get using Tailwind. The good and the bad.
