My week notes for the week of June 29 through July 5.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Short Week at Work

With the Independence Day holiday, I took an extra day and had a nice, short 3 day work week. I've been working on teaching myself ElasticSearch for the project I'm working on and was finally making some good headway. Hopefully my long weekend doesn't set me back too much.

### Running Again

The incredibly hot weather has (slightly) broken and I've dared to try some runs this week. It's still been too hot for me to do real distance, but I've hitting runs in the 3-4 mile range which has felt good.

  There's gotta be a better way to handle footnotes. They can be frustrating when reading a physical book, they're annoying too in webpages when trying to go back to the line you were at.
