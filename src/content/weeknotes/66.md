My week notes for the week of August 31 through September 6.
<!-- excerpt -->

## More Dave Hause

After seeing Dave Hause at Spruce Street Harbor Park in Philly, we went into Wayne to see him again for a record release show and party. It was at a cool little bar venue called [118 North](https://118northwayne.com/). It was a good set and nice to hear all the new songs.

## Hockey Starting Back Up

It's still technically between seasons, but I rented one of the rinks for an hour for my team to practice and then scrimmage. It was a lot of fun but damn was I gassed after.

## Practicing Guitar

I've been practicing guitar more. I still have quite a bit to work on, but the back-to-back nights of concerts, I've been inspired to play more. I also spent an hour-plus removing all the stickers from my electric guitar that I stupidly put on as a teenager when I first tried to pick up the guitar.
