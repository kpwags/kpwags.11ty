My week notes for the week of January 12 through January 18.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### New Living Room

We bought our old sofa off Craigslist 12+ years ago. It lasted us well as our cats and dog did quite a number on it. We finally decided that it was time to replace it, and our whole living room set (kinda) while we were at it. We threw out our large sectional and replaced it with a couch/love seat and ottoman combo. We donated our coffee and end tables to Habitat for Humanity and the room looks brand new...adult(ish) even. We still need to get new end tables, but it feels so new.

### Meet Tess

On Friday, we adopted a one year old Great Pyrenees Mix dog. She’s absolutely adorable. We’re still adjusting to her and her to us. She’s incredibly smart and has tons of energy. We also think she has some husky in her.

  It’s nice to see another company reach orbit. Good for Blue Origin.

  Tesla and Elon Musk might be the ones focused on in this, but the amount of surveillance being added to cars nowadays is disconcerting.

  It can be incredibly easy to leave code in place even if it stops being used. Over time it builds and builds causing side effects that you don’t necessarily realize.

  More culture-war bullshit from the Republicans at the cost of the trans community. I fear how many lives will be lost due to the attacks from the right.
