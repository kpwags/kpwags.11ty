My week notes for the week of June 22 through June 28.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Learning About ElasticSearch

I've been digging into using ElasticSearch with .NET at work. The next big project I've been assigned requires it's use. It's new to me, but I'm hoping to pick it up fast enough to be dangerous.

### Revisiting My Photography Site

When I switched from Next.js to 11ty, one of the things that bit the dust was my photography pages. Several months ago, I started rebuilding it as a standalone site (in 11ty of course). That didn't end up going very far, but I've decided to revisit it. I upgraded to the lastest version of 11ty and have started to lay out the pages. I'm going to have to see if I can find the images I had used so long ago, but I'll get there.

### MacOS Sequoia Issues

I updated my MacBook Pro to run the latest (stable) version of MacOS, MacOS Sequoia. Needless to say, that was a mistake. My MacBook is consistently crashing and locking up when I have it docked. I've been running primarily off my Ubuntu desktop.
