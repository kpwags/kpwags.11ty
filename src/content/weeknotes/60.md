My week notes for the week of July 20 through July 26.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Checking Out Some Local Breweries

On Saturday, my wife and I ended up venturing out to try some new local breweries. We started at [Levante](https://www.levantebrewing.com/) which we had been to before, but we also went to [Locust Lane](https://www.locustlanecraftbrewery.com/home1) and then [La Cabra](https://www.lacabrabrewing.com/), neither of which we had ever been to. The beer was good as was the food.

### Lower Screen Time

I [wrote about wanting to limit my screen time](/posts/2025/07/20/health-wellness-changes/) and so far, so good. After tweaking my screen time settings on my iPhone, my screen time this week was:

- Tuesday: 0:12
- Wednesday: 1:06
- Thursday: 1:06
- Friday: 1:09
- Saturday: 1:40

### Better Diet

Along with the screen time, I want to try to get in the habit of better eating. With the exception of yesterday's brewery tour, I've been doing a better job of not snacking and keeping my food intake at a better place. I went on several runs and got some lifting sessions in as well (my legs still aren't happy with me for that).
