My week notes for the week of December 1 - December 7.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Work Laptop Dying

Monday after I was done for the day, the IT department at the company I work for asked me to update my laptop to Windows 11. The update ended up bricking my computer and I had to get a new one overnight shipped to me. It's both annoying and satisfying to have a new machine starting over from scratch. The bad news is that it put me in a position where I'll now have to piece together all of the pull requests that I've been documenting over the last year for the big feature I'm working on.

### Couch Shopping

My wife and I are in the process of revamping our living room, and the first big piece will be to replace our couch. We got this couch 12+ years ago second hand off Craigslist and it's served us well. But now it's time to find something new. It's our first time buying a piece of furniture too as all our furniture was hand me downs or craigslist finds. It's been an adventure so far.

### Phantoms - Bears Game

Saturday night was the Lehigh Valley Phantoms Teddy Bear Toss game. If you're not aware, many minor league hockey teams have a teddy bear and stuffed animal drive in an ingenious way. Everyone brings stuffed animals and when the Phantoms score their first goal everyone throws the stuffed animals onto the ice. It's fun and for a good cause.

Sadly the Phantoms lost the game 3-2 in overtime.

I went to Drexel and did 3 co-ops or internships during my five years there. They were incredibly helpful getting me acclimated to the jobs I've had throughout my career and helped getting my foot in the door with some real experience.
