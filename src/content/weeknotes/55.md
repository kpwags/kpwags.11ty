My week notes for the week of June 15 through June 21.
<!-- excerpt -->

### Temperatures Rising

It feels too early for this. We're starting to see temperatures increasing to high-80s and low-90s. I got a run in Saturday morning since I'm not sure how much running I'll be able to get in this upcoming week. Running in the 90s is not fun. I miss spring.

### Birthday Week

I've completed another orbit around the sun. I don't feel any older...or wiser. Maybe a little more crotchety though. My wife and I took the second half of the week off to spend some time together to celebrate. It was fun, we checked out a coffeehouse distillery we'd been meaning to go to, wandered around a local town visiting some distilleries and breweries. It was a good birthday week and weekend.
