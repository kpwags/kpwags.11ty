The weather is finally starting to warm up some.

## Back to Running

Now that the temperatures are no longer in the single digits, I've take advantage to go on some runs. I ran 4.11 miles Wednesday and 4.29 miles Saturday. Both runs felt good and while I'm a little slower, I was able to keep my heart rate in zone 2 mostly and never really felt out of breath.

## Cleaning Up Code at Work

The project I was pulled into at work went better than I anticipated. I was able to find the cause of all the urgent bugs and get them fixed and deployed. I also feel like I got the code into a better place. I'm still not thrilled with the UX, and might see if there's an appetite to modernize it a bit, but either way I was able to get things into a working spot.

## A Day Date in Ardmore

My wife and I both took Friday off and made a little day date of it. We went out to [Char & Stave](https://www.charandstave.com/) in Ardmore, PA and had some coffee-themed cocktails and drinks while sitting and working on some of our projects. We moseyed over to [Mavey Books](https://www.maveybooks.com/) (gotta love independent bookstores), and then had an early dinner at [Tired Hands](https://tiredhands.com/). It was a nice way to spend the day and we were able to avoid the Valentine's Day crowds Saturday.
