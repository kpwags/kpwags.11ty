Double week issue here with my trip to New York City last weekend. Though outside the trip, it's been a quiet two weeks.
<!-- excerpt -->

## New York City

My wife and I took a long weekend to the Big Apple last weekend. We stayed in a hotel near Bryant Park and enjoyed a quiet weekend wandering around the city. The weather was a little on the chilly side, but was still enjoyable.

## Stupid Cold

This past week I've been battling a cold. A nasty cough has kept me home and resting. Not sure where exactly I caught it. New York is certainly a likely possibility but it made it a quiet week.

## Jedi: Survivor

I've been playing a lot of Jedi: Survivor. I loved Jedi: Outcast and this is a good sequel. It is so satisfying force pulling a Stormtrooper towards you and then slicing him up with your lightsaber. The story of the first game was good and the second has been enjoyable so far. I'd highly recommend it.
