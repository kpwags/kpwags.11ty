My week notes for the week of October 6 through 12, 2024.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Accessibility Learnings

At work, the accessibility review for the work I did several months ago came back and I'm going through all the different results and recommendations. Got a decent amount of work to do, but I don’t mind. I’m learning a lot about accessibility in the process, which I appreciate. I'm also appreciative that the company I work for cares enough to do this.

### Getting Back into Lifting

With all the running I did over the last two months, my lifting routine has taken a hit. I think I only lifted once, maybe twice in September. While cardio is certainly important, I want to get back into strength training as well. This week I tried to start where I left off and realized that while my strength certainly hasn’t disappeared, it might be better to lessen the weights a tad. I ended up stopping the cycle I was on, de-loading slightly, and starting a new cycle. It seemed to work well enough through the 2 sessions I’ve done so far. I was able to hit most of my lifts. My legs and core muscles are a little sore, but it was to be expected since they haven’t been worked in a little while as they were this week.

### Lehigh Valley Phantoms Season Opener

On Saturday, Lauren and I went up to Allentown to see the Lehigh Valley Phantoms season opener. They’re the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers. We started the evening like we normally do by having dinner and drinks at [Fegley’s Brew Works](https://thebrewworks.com), followed by the short walk across the street to the arena.

The game was kind of a weird one. The Phantoms seems tired and off most of the night. They were playing the Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL affiliate of the New York Rangers) and it always seemed like Hartford was threatening in the Phantoms zone the entire game. Despite that, the Phantoms outshot the Wolf Pack 49-25 and won in a shootout 4-3. (Goes to show you that shots don’t mean much) If you had hidden the shot totals and team goals, I would’ve guessed the results would be reversed. Oh well, a win is a win, and it’s only the first game. Hopefully it’s just a bit of rust they can shake off.

### Interesting Links

Lately there’s been a fair amount of debate over the state of web components. Some are arguing strenuously in favor of web components, others not so much. Lea I think does a good job here talking about how what web components are and what they can do, as well as the other use cases are and why the two can’t always be compared equally.
