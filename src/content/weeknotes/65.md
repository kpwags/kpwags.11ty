My week notes for the week of August 24 through August 30.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Gorgeous Weather

The weather has dipped back into the 70s this week which gave me the excuse to hang out on the porch in the evening since I didn't feel like dying from sweat.

### A Blip in My Lifting Routine

I had been doing a good job sticking to my lifting schedule. Every other day, like clockwork. This week I pushed it off twice. I was tired one day and opted to take Tess on a long walk and then beautiful weather made me opt for a run outdoors.  Not mad about it, I've been doing a better job of not skipping out and staying on track so I can start seeing progress with my strength again.

### Free Dave Hause Show in Philly

Saturday we ventured into Philly to Spruce Street Harbor Park to see a free [Dave Hause](https://www.davehause.com/) concert. The weather was beautiful and we were able to walk around, grab dinner, and see a good show. [The Tisburys](https://thetisburys.com/) opened and gave me another band's discography to dig into. I talked with a few of them after at the bar and even bumped into some members of [Crossed Keys](https://crossedkeys.net/) who we saw back in December. It was a fun evening.
