Happy Gotcha Day Tess!
<!-- excerpt -->

## Double Hockey Practice Session

The league I play goalie in does six weeks of practice sessions between the ten weeks of games. I took shots for both practice sessions. Two hours of up and down was quite the workout. My legs were quite happy when I sat down to read a bit before going to bed.

## Having Tess for a Year

We celebrated Tess' gotcha day. Feels hard to believe we've had her for one year now. She has taken a little while to get used to us and her new home and routine, but she's the sweetest girl. She's pretty cute too.

## Snow

We got more snow this weekend. It feels so peaceful with a white coating on everything. Tess absolutely loves it as well and we spent plenty of time with her in our backyard so she could run around and play in it.

## Far Cry New Dawn

I completed Far Cry New Dawn. The gameplay was fun, but the story was shorter and kind of predictable. I got it on sale for $10 though, so for that price, definitely a steal.

## Cooking

### Slow Cooker Chicken Fajita Soup

[This](https://therecipecritic.com/slow-cooker-chicken-fajita-soup/) turned out fantastic. It was super easy to make and it gave my wife and I 3 dinners. The only thing I changed was we put the cheese in our individual bowls rather than the entire soup.

### Pork Chops with Green Tomato Chutney

I made this [recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/pork-with-green-tomato-chutney-11461899) Tuesday night. It wasn't bad. I did substitute heirloom tomatoes for the green tomatoes as I could not find green tomatoes so I'm not sure if that had an adverse effect on things. As for the wild rice, I believe you can use regular rice should you so desire.

### One Pot Greek Chicken and Orzo

[This](https://damndelicious.net/2024/01/26/one-pot-greek-chicken-and-orzo/) turned out really well. I think cooking the Orzo in the chicken stock is what really made it stand out. The tomatoes and feta worked as well. The only thing I might change next time would be to bake the chicken thighs. Would probably save some time. Either way though, it works.
