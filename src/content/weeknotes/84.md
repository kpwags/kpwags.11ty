It was mostly a lazy week finished with a concert to finish it off.

## More Snow

It snowed again Sunday. Fortunately this time I could stay home and enjoy it from the comfort of our couch. I did have to shovel both Sunday and Monday, but alas, such is the joy of living in the northeast. Tess continued to enjoy the fresh powder.

## Lazy Week

I had a mostly lazy week. It was too cold to run outside and between family events and life in general, I had a hard time finding time to lift or get my bike attached to the stationary machine. I did do another double hockey practice Monday and had a game Thursday, but other than that, it was mostly quiet.

## Menzingers Concert

With snowmageddon bearing down on us, but thankfully not supposed to start until early Sunday morning, we drove up to Allentown to see The Menzingers play at [Archer Music Hall](https://www.archermusichall.com). We had pre-show drinks and dinner at [Fegley's](https://thebrewworks.com) and caught a good punk show. [Lax Poetic](https://laxpoetic.bandcamp.com/album/my-best-impression-of-being-okay), [The Ergs](http://dorkrockcorkrod.com), and [I Am the Avalanche](https://www.iamtheavalanche.net) all opened for them and it was a good show. The Menzingers opened with [America (You're Freaking Me Out)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5Y5wPiY0L4) which seemed quite apt with all the hell that's going on here in the states. Thankfully the snow held off and we were able to get home safely before it started.

## Recipes

### Air Fryer Pork Belly

I've made [this recipe](https://therecipecritic.com/air-fryer-pork-belly/) before. It's a little messy, but the marinade and pork belly is delicious. I'd also recommend using a toothpick to stick little holes in the fat before cutting the pork belly. It's supposed to help with getting crackled skin.
