I spent the last week in Cape May for my anniversary, so this is a double issue.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Cape May Trip

Cape May, NJ is our happy place. It's our favorite vacation spot, and we felt like it was a good spot to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed in Congress Hall and had a long relaxing vacation. We took it easy for the most part and explored some of our favorite breweries and wineries in the Cape May area. It was nice to sit, enjoy some wine and beer, and read and even get some writing done.

For the wineries, we went to [Hawk Haven](https://www.hawkhavenvineyard.com) and [Jessie Creek](https://jessiecreekwinery.com). For the Breweries, we stopped at [Slack Tide](https://www.slacktidebrewingco.com) and [Gusto](https://www.gustobrewco.com).

It was a much needed vacation. We pushed off vacations this year after adopting Tess. We wanted to get her used to her new home and were hesitant to board her. Thankfully, she's gotten used to us and her new routine and home that we felt comfortable to board her for an extended period. It's her doggie day care location so she seemed to have a good time and is happy to be home.

## Everything Else

The Cape May trip basically enveloped these last 2 weeks. The week before I was getting ready for the trip.

My other hockey league started back up. I had to miss one game due to vacation, but the first game was hard fought, but we fell short, losing 3-1.

I did spend some time building a new website for the hockey team I captain. It's a static site built in [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and I'm not sure what all will get added to it. I just figured I might as well.
