My week notes for the week of August 10 through August 16.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### New Lifting Routine

I started my new strength training routine on Sunday and I have to say, this is the most excited I've been about lifting since I was going for the 1,000 lbs. club a couple years ago. I don't really have any set goals this time around other than to get more consistent with my strength training workouts.

### Halestorm & Volbeat in Concert

Saturday I met up with my best friend in Hershey, Pennsylvania to see Halestorm and Volbeat in concert. Prior to the show I stopped by Midstate Distillery and YAH Brewing in downtown Hershey. It's a nice little town. It was good seeing him and the concert was good too.

  Drew makes some good points about how this could have some very noticeable negative side effects with regards to ESPN's sports journalism and the NFL.
