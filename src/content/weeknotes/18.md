My week notes for the weeks of September 15 through September 21 & September 22 through September 28. This is a double issue due to vacation.

## Week at the Shore

I spent the week down at the shore in Cape May, New Jersey. My wife and I rented a condo for the week and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the shore after the busy season.

## Nick Siriani, What Are You Thinking?

Sunday we ventured out to a local bar to watch our Eagles take on the Saints. I’m not quite sure how we walked out of that game with a win, but we did, squeaking past the saints 15-12. The game was frustrating with more Jalen Hurts turnovers and some boneheaded decisions by Eagles head coach Nick Siriani. Our defense played very well though (probably saving the game for us) holding the Saints to only a field goal for most of the game. A win is a win, but I wish I felt better about it.

## Finished Node/React Version of Media Repository

I finished up my Node/React rewrite of my media repository. It's a shame I couldn't stick with Blazor, but given my hosting options, it made the most sense. Either way, I'm happy with how it turned out. I made the UI a little bit nicer and added a few niceties I was planning on adding to the Blazor version.

I still do intend on rebuilding it once more using web components and using more standard HTML/CSS/JS rather than React.

## Jessie Creek Winery

Monday, we spent the afternoon at [Jessie Creek Winery](https://jessiecreekwinery.com). I spent some of the time writing a few blog post drafts and had a good time relaxing and tasting a flight of the local wines.

## Beer Tasting

Tuesday, we stopped by [Behr Brewing](https://www.behrbrewing.com) and then [Cape May Brewwing](https://capemaybrewery.com) for lunch and some beers. Since New Jersey laws make it difficult for breweries to serve food, most breweries are BYOF (Bring Your Own Food), so we made some sandwiches, grabbed some fruit and spent the afternoon trying some beers at Behr and Cape May Brewery.

Behr we had only been to right after it opened and I didn’t remember much of what I had. The beers I had this time around were good. I really enjoyed their *Behrfest*, a take on a Märzen style beer.

I’ve had plenty of beers from Cape May Brewery, but they always keep certain brews exclusively at their tasting room. I had their *Sea Seeker* IPA and it was delicious.

## More Beer

Wednesday we ventured further north and had lunch at [Ludlam Island Brewing](https://www.ludlamisland.com) for lunch. Their kitchen does barbecue and it was delicious. The beer was good as well. I had a flight with several IPAs and they were all delicious.

After Ludlam Island, we traveled down to [Slack Tide Brewing](https://www.slacktidebrewingco.com). I tried their pineapple milkshake IPA and their pineapple, tangerine & coconut fruited sour. Both were delicious.

Our final stop was [Gusto Brewing](https://www.gustobrewco.com). I had a New England IPA and a black IPA. Both were tasty.

## Interesting Links

I think in the future I’m going to share some of the links I’ve read and why I liked them.

<shared-link title="Let’s Bring Back Browsing" url="https://christianheilmann.com/2024/09/15/lets-bring-back-browsing/" author="Christian Heilmann">
Chris talks about aimlessly surfing the web at the beginning of the internet age and how we’ve slowly moved away from it. I, like him, remember the early days of the internet and would love to see more of that come back to today’s web.

I haven’t upgraded to MacOS Sequoia yet, but have heard about some of its decisions regarding alerts about screen recording. John talks about alert fatigue and the balance between making sure those less technical can get alerted  for permission checks while allowing the advanced users freedom to not have to worry about constantly being nagged by the OS about things they’re fully aware of.

<shared-link title="Never Forget What Killed The Oakland A’s" url="https://defector.com/ode-on-an-ass-hat-oakland-athletics-last-game" author="Ray Ratto">
The Oakland Athletics are no more. For the next 3 seasons they will be in Sacramento, then who knows. As a sports fan, I feel bad for Oakland fans. In the past several years they went from having 3 major sports teams, to now none. Thanks to greed from the owners, they all left. I guess the one upside is that their tax dollars aren't paying for a new stadium, but it still sucks.
