My week notes for the week of May 4 through May 10.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Chuck Wendig and Clay McLeod Chapman

On Wednesday night, I went to the [Doylestown Bookshop](https://doylestownbookshop.com) for an event with Chuck Wendig & Clay McLeod Chapman for Chuck's new book [The Staircase in the Woods](https://doylestownbookshop.com/book/9780593156568). It was an interesting event and the two authors were funny and insightful. I walked out with signed books from both.

### Weird Week for Exercise

I struggled to really get my normal exercise in this week. It was just a weird week with hockey 3 nights, the book signing, and an oddly timed haircut. I've been trying to get into a rhythm with lifting and running, and currently failing.
