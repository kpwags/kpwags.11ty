My week notes for the week of February 23 through March 1.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### A Lot of Hockey

I ended up playing a double-header Monday to help out one of the other net minders. Lost the first game 5-1, but won the second 7-3. I didn’t give up any bad goals so I can at least keep my head up after that, though there is always more to improve.

Tuesday I subbed in net for a team 3 divisions above where I normally play. The pace of play was much higher than I’m used to and ended up losing 5-3. But given the strength of the play and shots, I actually feel good about how I played.

Finally, Friday my other team played and won 8-0 in decisive fashion.

### Cory Doctorow Book Signing

On Saturday a local(ish) bookshop had Cory Doctorow come in for a book signing and talk after his book [Picks and Shovels](https://bookshop.org/p/books/picks-and-shovels-a-martin-hench-novel-cory-doctorow/21413549) came out. It was the first author event I’ve ever attended. Cory provided some interesting insight about both his writing and his activism. If you haven’t read any of his books, I’d highly recommend both his fiction and non-fiction.
