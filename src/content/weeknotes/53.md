My week notes for the week of June 1 through June 7.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Kubernetes

At work, I've been working on getting some of the projects I've been working on migrated to Kubernetes. It was my first time working with Kubernetes and I'm still not sure what it really gets us, but we cutover the projects early in the week with minimal interruptions, so I'll call it a success. I have a few more I'll be working on and will have to dig in a bit once I get some time to learn more.

### The Return of the Heat

I knew it would come eventually, but I was hoping for some more time. The temperatures got back into the mid-to-high 80s this week and I'm not a fan.

### TopGolf

[TopGolf](https://topgolf.com/) was offering a summer pass offering unlimited daily 2 hour slots (with some caveats) so I decided to pick it up. I suck at golf but generally enjoy being out on the course. I'm hoping to get out more this summer and work on my swing to maybe not be quite as much of an embarrassment as I am right now.

  I just love the analogy of this and how true it is in so many fields.

  It's amazing how much one can still learn in web development and how much customization browsers and CSS support.
