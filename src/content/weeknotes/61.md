My week notes for the week of July 27 through August 2.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Bombers Season Over

The hockey team I captain, the *Bombers* had their final game of the season this past week. While the season was less that ideal as we finished 4-11-1, we did finish it up with a nice win. Still have a few games left with my other team, and then a bit of a rest before it starts up all over again.

### Media Repository Improvements

I've been on a reading tear this year, already nearing my 2025 book goal. Managing this in my repository has been easy enough, but I wanted to make some of the management easier so I added a quick "Finish Book" button and modal that will allow me quickly mark what I'm currently reading finished. Maybe I'll do something similar for marking a book as started. Small changes, but it makes the little things easier.
