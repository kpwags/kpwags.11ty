My week notes for the week of September 14 through September 20.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Lucero Concert

On Tuesday I went to see Lucero live at the Ardmore Music Hall. They were celebrating the 20 year anniversary of the release of [Nobody's Darlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6RoAjmDPBw&list=PL4C072D4A4D7B097E). They played the album front to back and then some of their hits. It was a good show and I got to meet Ben Nichols, their frontman at the end of the show.

## Lazy(ish) Week

From a fitness perspective, it was a lazy week. I decided to take a needed rest day on Monday and then with the concert and being exhausted the day after, I didn't do much those days either. Tried to lift Friday and tweaked my back. Nothing major, just wasn't my week to be active.

## New Winery & Brewery

My wife and I didn't really have any plans Saturday so we ventured down to the Chadds Ford area to check out [Penns Woods Winery](http://pennswoodswinery.com/). They had some good wines and their property was nice. Plenty of tables in a field with some canopies. The weather was beautiful so it was great to just sit outside and enjoy some wine.

On the way home, we stopped for dinner at the [2SP Tap House](https://2sptaphouse.com/). Dinner was delicious and the beers were good too.
