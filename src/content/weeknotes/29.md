My week notes for the week of December 15 - December 21.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### I-League Season Over

The Fall I-League season came to an end on Monday. We lost 4-3 in a tightly fought game. It was fun and am looking forward to the winter season starting in mid-February.

### Last Working Day of the Year

Thursday was my last day of work for the year. I'll be taking almost 2 weeks off to just rest and relax over the holidays. Don't really have much planned, just figured some relaxation was warranted.

### Last Minute Christmas Shopping

Friday I spent running errands and picking up some last minute gifts. Stores were crowded and I really should've done a better job of planning ahead more.
