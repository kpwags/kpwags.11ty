My week notes for the week of August 17 through August 23.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Notes

### Spring-Summer Hockey Seasons Over

Monday marked the end of the other hockey league I play in's season. Now, I get a few weeks off before the fall/winter seasons begin.

### Continuing Strength Training

I've been doing a good job sticking with my strength training. It feels like most of the year I've been having starts and stops with it, often substituting walks and runs instead, but this time I've been doing a pretty good job of hitting the gym every other day.

### Toying with Another Redesign

I've been considering adding more themes to my site for the heck of it, but the CSS for my site has become a little convoluted. I'm playing around with some ideas to simplify the styling, 11ty code and a few other items.

  It still kind of amazes me how much one can do in the browser with only HTML and never writing a single line of JavaScript.

  There's a reason why there are more HTML elements than just `<div/>` & `<span/>`. Using the right ones helps with accessibility and letting the browser know what parts of websites are meant for.
