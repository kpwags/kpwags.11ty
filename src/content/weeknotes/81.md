A new year, ~~a new~~ same old me.

## Writing

I set my goal for 2026 to write 350,000 words. I think it's doable, but I didn't just start on January 1st. I've been trying to write more these last 2 weeks of 2025. I wrote some blog posts, wrote more on my fantasy story, and tried to put more words to paper in general.

## Celebrating 15 Years

My wife and I celebrated 15 years together this week. It was New Year's 2011 when we first started dating and now I can't begin to imagine my life without her.

## Far Cry New Dawn

I really enjoyed Far Cry 5. New Dawn, a sequel has drawn me in as well. The game play is fun and some of the tweaks they added from Far Cry 5 seem perfect. I've been enjoying it and would recommend it, though I would highly suggest you play Far Cry 5 first.
