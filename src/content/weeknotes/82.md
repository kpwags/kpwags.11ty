First week back at work since mid-December. It was thankfully a quiet week.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Monday Night Hockey

The *Bombers*, the team I captain had a Monday night game. We were playing a team we'd had trouble against in the past but manage to come away with a strong 6-1 win. We played well and other than a late 3rd period goal, we managed to keep them contained.

## Writing

I struggled to maintain focus this week unfortunately. I wrote every day, but not as much as I intended. I really should try to better configure my site blockers to help me maintain my focus.

## Nice Weather Mid-Week

Mid-week the weather crept up to 50°F (10°C). It was a little strange for January, but I took advantage to go for a run and take Tess for a long walk. I should be concerned about weather this warm this time of year, but I'll take advantage of it.

## Cooking

### Gnocchi and Steak Hash

I had found [this recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/gnocchi-and-steak-hash-17125398) in the magazine a while back, and have been incredibly happy with how it turns out. The only thing is its yield is a little low for just my wife and I. It's more than one meal for the two of us, but not quite two. Maybe I'll double it next time.
