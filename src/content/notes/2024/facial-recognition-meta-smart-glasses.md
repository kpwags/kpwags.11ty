> A pair of students at Harvard have built what big tech companies refused to release publicly due to the overwhelming risks and danger involved: smart glasses with facial recognition technology that automatically looks up someoneâ€™s face and identifies them. The students have gone a step further too. Their customized glasses also pull other information about their subject from around the web, including their home address, phone number, and family members.

Oh boy. Having read [Your Face Belongs to Us](https://kpwags.com/books/kashmir-hill-your-face-belongs-to-us/) by Kashmir Hill last year, this doesn't surprise me. The genie is out of the bottle and I'm not quite sure how best to go about protecting ourselves from stuff like this.

I feel like a federal privacy law is a definite need, but I'm not sure how much that would go about stopping the dangers associated with this.
