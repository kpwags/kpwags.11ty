> I’ve been asked when interviewing for a front end ecommerce position how the Javascript event loop works — in detail. I told the interviewer I didn’t know, had never needed to in previous positions but was confident I could figure it out. They hired me. I’ve taken a similar tack when discussing other roles with interviewers — I don’t know, but I like to learn and I’ll figure it out. Don’t know enough React? I’ll learn. Don’t know bespoke framework/internal tool X? I’ll learn.

This is the correct mindset. Don’t try to BS through answers, people will figure it out. Learn the fundamentals and picking up new frameworks and libraries will be doable.
