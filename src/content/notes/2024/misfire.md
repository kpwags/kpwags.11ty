> This is why "give us your email address for 30% discount" popups and account signup forms are suddenly everywhere. Email addresses are stable, long-lived reidentifiers. Overt mechanisms like this are already replacing third-party cookies. Make no mistake: post-removal, tracking will continue for long as reidentification has perceived positive economic value. The only way to change that equation is legislation; anything else is a band-aid.

I’m kind of curious as to how much email aliases can help with this, and I don’t mean the ‘+’ in the email trick. I use FastMail for my email and can create truly unique emails for services I sign up for. Granted they all share the same domain, but they’re still different. It’s obviously not a panacea, but maybe something?
