> Web platform features operate under a whole different set of requirements and constraints:
> 
> - They need to last *decades*, not just until the next major release.
> - They need to not only cater to the current version of the web platform, but *anticipate* its future evolution and be compatible with it.
> - They need to be *backwards compatible* with the web as it was 20 years ago.
> - They need to be compatible with a slew of accessibility and internationalization needs that userland libraries often ignore at first.
> - They are developed in a distributed way, by people across many different organizations, with different needs and priorities.

> Usually, the result is ***more robust, but takes a lot longer***. That’s why I’ve often said that web standards are *“product work on hard mode”* — they include most components of regular product work (collecting user needs, designing ergonomic solutions, balancing impact over effort, leading without authority, etc.), but with the added constraints of a distributed, long-term, and compatibility-focused development process that would make most PMs pull their hair out in frustration and run screaming.
