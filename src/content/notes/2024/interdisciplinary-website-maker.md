> But now-a-days, any cross-disciplinary interest is easily interpreted as a lack of specialization and dedication to craft. If you’re doing design and code, how can you be really great at either? You’re not maximizing.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with specializing, I also don’t think there’s anything wrong with becoming a jack-of-all-trades.

Designers versus coders aside, I find it odd sometimes when people think that front end developers know no backend and vice versa. We all might be better in one area than another, but I feel like we can all contribute.
