> Chances are, the things you don’t like about CSS are the things you haven’t bothered to understand about it.

I will say, I did have gripes with CSS early in my career. The more I’ve used it though, the more I’ve grown to understand it. It can take some time to wrap your head around it. Dismissing it out of hand is not the answer.

> My brothers and sisters in Christ I want you to know that I care about your souls enough to share these truths with you:
>
> - You don’t need JavaScript to make a web page. 
> - You don’t need JavaScript to write styles. 
> - You don’t need JavaScript to make an animation
> - You don’t need JavaScript just to show content.

I take pride in that my site limits its use of JavaScript. JS certainly has its place and I do use it, but boy do some developers rely on it for tasks that just don’t need it.

Amen.
