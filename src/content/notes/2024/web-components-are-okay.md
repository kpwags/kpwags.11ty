> Again, I find these debates a bit tiresome. I think the fundamental issue, as I’ve previously said, is that people are talking past each other because they’re building different things with different constraints. It’s as if a salsa dancer criticized ballet for not being enough like salsa. There is more than one way to dance!

Nolan makes some good points talking about where web components work well, and where they fall short. "It depends" is an oft-used statement and I think far too often we miss the point that there are multiple ways to build things. Some methods and tooling are better than others in certain use cases, some are not. Rather than constantly arguing with one another over the minutia, we should go with what works best for us at the given time.
