I love this. Ever since the death of X/Twitter I’ve been much more focused on making sure that I control the data and content I post that means the most to me.

> **Own your data.** Your content, your metadata, your identity.

> **Use and publish visible data.** For humans first, machines second.

> **Above all, have fun.** When the web took off in the 90’s people began designing personal sites with tools such as GeoCities. These spaces had Java applets, garish green background and seventeen animated GIFs. It may have been ugly and badly coded but it was fun. Keep the web weird and interesting.
