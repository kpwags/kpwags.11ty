> It’s like and, but we have developed a whole language around what these symbols mean, right? Over the course of decades. And so, if we don’t use them anymore, and everything is AI generated. If we AI generate emojis, you know, we’re not going to have a common language around them anymore. So, I wonder how many people just, kind of, default to the old emojis will just still just because they maybe understand what they mean.

Kimberly Adams isn’t wrong. People have taken emojis and integrated them into language. In some cases the emoji doesn’t equate to its actual meaning. It’s going to be interesting if that starts to fade with some of this or if it will stick around.
