On the Infrastructure bill allotting funding for broadband internet:

> Unfortunately, a ton of that money is going to be given to giant telecom monopolies with a long history of [empty promises](https://www.techdirt.com/2014/06/24/everytime-att-wants-federal-approval-merger-policy-it-promises-its-necessary-to-deliver-100-broadband-then-doesnt-deliver/) and [half-completed networks](https://www.techdirt.com/2020/10/06/mississippi-says-att-took-283-million-network-it-never-fully-deployed/). But an impressive chunk will **also** wind up in the hands of smaller broadband ISPs, cooperatives, city-owned electrical utilities, and municipal broadband networks, allowing them to build fiber access out into areas that would have _never seen service otherwise_.

High speed internet is no longer a luxury. It powers today’s world and everyone deserves to have access to affordable, fast internet.

Monopolistic corporations have other ideas:

> Cox is very upset that not **all** of the state’s share of infrastructure bill broadband money is going to Cox, so they’re trying to pretend the process was somehow flawed

You wonder how much they’re just going to pocket and say the did something anyway.

I’m for anything that will open up even a modicum of competition and give people access to the Internet.
