> The question of whether CSS is a programming language serves only one purpose: to demote those who write it.
>
> There is no confusion that needs to be clarified, and no other purpose in asking, beyond the most trivial kind of pedantry.
>
> The debate itself is an act of gatekeeping, whether intentional or not. Its only significant effect is to elevate some work over other work, despite their essentially identical nature.
>
> The only meaningful function of the question is segregation.

I really don’t get the whole “CSS isn’t a programming language” crowd. I see what other developers can do with CSS and am amazed. It’s something I’ve been consistently trying to improve on. The gatekeeping stuff is just BS.
