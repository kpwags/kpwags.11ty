> It looks like everyone's favourite FIDO token provider might have an unpatchable vulnerability! Much _Sturm und Drang_ from the usual sources. But how bad is it really? Not so bad - but it does expose some weaknesses in the very idea of having physical tokens.

It also looks like the attacker will need:

- Physical access to key
- Username & password tied to account protected by key
- $11,000 worth of equipment

So yes, it doesn’t seem to be an “easy” attack, but geez…it’s always something.
