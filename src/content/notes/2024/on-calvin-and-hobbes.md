> It took no time at all to master Garfield, but when I started getting Calvin and Hobbes, I knew I was making progress; even when I didn’t understand the words, I could still marvel at the sheer exuberance and detail of the art.

I still read *Calvin & Hobbes* and I’m amazed at how much more I still get out of the strips. Bits and pieces of humor, insights into life, and more still permeate the strips.
