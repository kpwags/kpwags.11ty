> I look at some people’s personal websites and think, “Stupendous! If I ever reach that zenith of personal web design, I will call it quits.”
>
> Then I read a post by them later and they say something like, “Gah! I just really don’t like where I’m at with my personal website.”

I'm not a design wizard. I can often tell good design from bad, but I'm always wishing I could do better, and try to.

> It’s like our personal websites are a mirror to ourselves — a place where the mind’s eye must reconcile with the optical eye’s perception of reality.
>
> It’s a torturous affair, to be sure.

> And yet, people still publish those personal sites, those redesigns, those half-baked ideas.

I love this. Personal sites are awesome and I'm always trying to better mine. I love seeing others do the same.
