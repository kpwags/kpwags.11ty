There was always the running joke with how to center content. Then it became easier with CSS grid and flexbox. Now you donâ€™t even need that.

> With align-content available for block layout, you can achieve vertical alignment without needing to create a flex or grid layout for the property to work. No additional properties are needed as the item remains a block item, the only change is to the alignment.
