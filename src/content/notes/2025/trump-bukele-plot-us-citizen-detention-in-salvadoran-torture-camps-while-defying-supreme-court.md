> But the most chilling revelations came from an unguarded moment before the official White House stream began. In footage captured by Bukele’s team, Trump can be heard urging the construction of five more CECOT-style camps, specifically mentioning his desire to send “homegrown” — meaning US citizens — to these facilities

This is beyond scary. You now have a US President openly defying the Supreme Court and threatening to send US citizens to what essentially are concentration camps. We shouldn’t be sending *anyone* to El Salvador, full stop. The fact that the current administration is sending people there without any kind of due process, and is now considering sending citizens there as well should be raising every single alarm bell.

> If you don’t see all of this as one of the darkest days in American history, in which the President is openly embracing disappearing people without due process in the name of “liberty,” you are a part of the problem. Fascism has risen in America, and it is being aided by a foreign dictator whom Trump admires.

Couldn’t say it better myself.
