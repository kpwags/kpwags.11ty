> The nation is desperate for its elected officials tasked with protecting our democracy to finally get busy doing it, and if it won’t be Republicans then it must be Democrats who rise to the occasion. Yet here are Democrats not only persisting with normal order in the face of an imminent and unprecedented threat against our democracy but using it to increase the danger. Even if prioritizing collegiality over the direct action Trump and DOGE’s assault on our democratic institutions calls for could be justified as a means of dulling the edge of the worst through back channels, it is a shocking betrayal of public trust to use their position to sharpen it.

> Because instead of leading the way to save our nation far too many Democrats are using the power and privilege they were entrusted with to undermine free speech, the last tool that the people themselves have to wield against tyranny. It makes these Democrats worse than useless in the fight to save our Constitutional order; it makes them accomplices in its dismantling.
