> When we use the term "best practice", it sounds like what we're saying is, "what you've done is fine, but here's another way you *could* have done it." When in fact, what we're really saying is, "I want you to fix this accessibility issue, but I can't technically fail you on it, because it's outside the scope of this particular standard."
