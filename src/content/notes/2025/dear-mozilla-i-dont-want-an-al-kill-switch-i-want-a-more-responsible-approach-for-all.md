> I understand the backlash Mozilla faced after announcing more AI in the browser, scepticism about the product direction is warranted for many reasons. At the same time, I see how some of the features could be useful, and that other big tech companies are less responsible about it. Mozilla tries to be responsible and my hope is for **more of that**, it's the reason I and many others choose Mozilla products.

> I hope Mozilla succeeds in their aim to do AI “right”, adhering to the [manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/), and inspires others to do the same. It's very much needed too, as at this rate our industry is on the way to beat big tobacco and big oil in breaking things.

I share this hope too, I just want this to be all opt-in rather than opt-out. I want Firefox to remain viable, but fully understand how this can erode trust very quickly.
