> A lot of us spend the majority of our days in front of a screen. We have online conversations and collaborate with people from all over the world. We read each other’s blog posts and social media rants. But behind every line of code, behind every post about the latest CSS tricks, behind every talk and video tutorial, there’s a real person. A person with a story, with struggles, with a life. And a few of those people are now here at the conference. That’s when you realize: the Web isn’t just a bunch of servers and websites. The Web is the people building it. The Web is community.

I can't say I've ever been to a conference, but the community out there is awesome. So many web devs building cool stuff and sharing their creations.
