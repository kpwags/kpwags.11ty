> HTML isn’t just how we place elements on a page. It’s a *language* – with a vocabulary that expresses meaning
> 
>  Tags like `<article>`, `<nav>` and `<section>` aren't *decorative*. They express *intent*. They signal *hierarchy*. They tell machines what your content *is*, and how it *relates* to everything else.

I know I could be better about this, and I try to use the right tags to help with accessibility.

> If everything is a `<div>` or a `<span>`, then nothing is *meaningful*.

This is why I'm not always a fan of frameworks.
