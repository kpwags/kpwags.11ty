> I regret to tell you that there is no grand plan. There’s not even a proper conspiracy. It’s happening because Trump is an idiot and has filled his administration with fellow idiots and yes men. They’re just dumb fucking people, careless people, people who reject the notion of expertise as a liberal conspiracy, who don’t understand how the world works, and who don’t care when they break things.

I really have nothing more to add. This administration is just disaster after disaster. In this case, they're just causing so much harm unnecessarily. 

> Real people are going to have their lives destroyed. The economy isn’t just a series of numbers, it’s real people. People will lose their businesses, their jobs, their savings. Children will go hungry in America (and many other countries) because of this. We’re killing jobs and growth and markets in service of one delusional idiot’s resentment of foreign trade. And I hate even more the parade of sycophants who still try to dress it up as some sort of grand strategy. There’s nothing behind the curtain. The emperor has no clothes. He’s just a dumb idiot and you will keep being wrong about him until you incorporate this fact.
