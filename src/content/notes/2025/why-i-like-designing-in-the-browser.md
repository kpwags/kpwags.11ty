While I’m not always thinking about the design aspect as much in my day-to-day work, the idea reminds me very much of how I prototype. Often I am tasked with spikes at work to figure out how to do something or if it can be done. All the documentation in the world doesn’t beat using the documentation to build and experiment with a small proof of concept to get your hands dirty and to see what can be done.
