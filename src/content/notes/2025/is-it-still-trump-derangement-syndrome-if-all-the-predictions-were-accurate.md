> Every single person who said we were being hysterical about Trump being an existential threat should be forced to explain how the President seizing control of the capital’s police force and deploying military units to forcibly relocate citizens represents normal democratic governance.
> 
> They called us hysterical when we said he’d use the military against civilians. He’s literally doing it right now.
> They called us alarmist when we said he’d seize control of law enforcement. He just placed D.C. police under the direct command of his Attorney General.
> 
> They called us deranged when we said he’d create fake emergencies to justify authoritarian power grabs. He’s invoking emergency powers while violent crime is at a 30-year low.
> 
> They said the institutions would hold. The institutions are being commandeered in real time.
> 
> They said the generals would refuse illegal orders. The National Guard is already deployed.
> 
> They said we were exaggerating the fascist threat. He’s literally declaring “Liberation Day” while seizing control of the capital.
> 
> Remember who told you this was hysteria.
