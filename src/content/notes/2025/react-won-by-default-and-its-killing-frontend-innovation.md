> When teams need a new frontend, the conversation rarely starts with “What are the constraints and which tool best fits them?” It often starts with “Let’s use React; everyone knows React.” That reflex creates a self-perpetuating cycle where network effects, rather than technical fit, decide architecture.

I'd be lying if I said that my knowledge of React makes it a quick choice.

> React’s dominance creates self-reinforcing barriers. Job postings ask for “React developers” rather than “frontend engineers,” limiting skill diversity. Component libraries and team muscle memory create institutional inertia.
> 
> Risk-averse leaders choose the “safe” option. Schools teach what jobs ask for. The cycle continues independent of technical merit.
> 
> That’s not healthy competition; it’s ecosystem capture by default.
