> But as I work more with these tools in and outside of work, I have really re-learned how much I do love coding, and don’t find it that tedious. I don’t really *like* vibe coding. There’s no joy in it. There’s no “YAY I am a GENIUS because I FIGURED IT OUT” feeling. It’s just there. It’s boring.

There really is something about building things from the ground up and seeing them come alive. There's *real* joy in solving a tough problem or fixing a troublesome bug. AI will never take that away.
