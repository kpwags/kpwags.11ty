> Carr, again, could be doing any number of things to actually help markets function or improve consumer welfare. Instead he’s harassing a streaming TV provider he has no authority over for not carrying a religious channel not all that many people watched in the first place. This again aligns pretty well with the MAGA mantra that they believe in “free speech,” but only if they agree with what’s being said.

This is what gets me the most about this. Carr and company could be working to make sure every American has access to high speed internet, but instead they’re attacking first amendment rights.
