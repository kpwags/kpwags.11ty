In a recent White House press briefing, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the upcoming Trump tax cuts bill. Her response:

> "This bill does not add to the deficit. In fact according the Council of Economic Advisors, this bill will save 1.6 trillion dollars."

Kai Rysdall, the fantastic host of the [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/) economic news program calls her out and added some great context in the closing of the episode.

> "It is the policy of this program as I have said repeatedly over the years that facts matter. So here are the facts. The president's press secretary is lying. I'll cite a group not inside the White House for evidence. The Penn Wharton Budget Model. The overall deficit increase in the bill as approved by various house committees is 4.9 trillion dollars over 10 years. That is offset Penn Wharton and the White House do say, by spending cuts totaling 1.6 trillion dollars. So in fact the bill does add to the deficit to the tune of 3.3 trillion dollars, again over 10 years. And just so we're all clear, no tax cut in the history of taxes or cuts to them, has ever paid for itself."
