> But it’s a trap. Vibe coding doesn’t create developers; it creates *fragile intermediaries*. People who can generate code but cannot read, debug, or maintain it.

> If you’re a new developer, this isn’t a shortcut. It’s a cliff. And you’re being encouraged to run straight toward it.

There's a reason people are offering services cleaning up vibe code...and getting hired to do just that. Learning the basics is important, use AI to supplement your coding if you must, but know how code works.

> The result is a dangerous illusion of competence. You can generate output, but you cannot command it. When it breaks (and it will), you have no map, no tools, and no idea why. This isn’t coding: it’s **outsourcing your own understanding**.
