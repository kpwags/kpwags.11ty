> Eventually every vibe coder reaches the point where the returns start heavily diminishing. Their site gets hacked and they need to actually sink the time to learn how security works. The app gets too big for context windows and things start looking and functioning inconsistently. Real frontend engineers who know what they are doing are hired to implement a consistent design system and UX.

I think that's the biggest thing with vibe coding, you want to build a simple little tool for yourself, it can probably work well enough. Want to build a new SaaS product...whelp...good luck with that.

> There is no secret herbal medicine that prevents all disease sitting out in the open if you just follow the right Facebook groups. There is no AI coding revolution available if you just start vibing. You are not missing anything. Trust yourself. You are enough.

> Oh, and don't scroll LinkedIn. Or Twitter. Ever.

Always good advice.
