> The Harvard Business Review study came out the [day after a _Financial Times_analysis_](https://www.ft.com/content/e93e56df-dd9b-40c1-b77a-dba1ca01e473) of hundreds of earnings reports and shareholder meeting transcripts filed by S&P 500 companies that found huge firms are having trouble articulating the specific benefits of widespread AI adoption but have had no trouble explaining the risks and downsides the technology has posed to their businesses: “The biggest US-listed companies keep talking about artificial intelligence. But other than the ‘fear of missing out,’ few appear to be able to describe how the technology is changing their businesses for the better,” the _Financial Times_ found. “Most of the anticipated benefits, such as increased productivity, were vaguely stated and harder to categorize than the risks.”
