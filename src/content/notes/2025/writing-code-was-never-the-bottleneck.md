> The marginal cost of adding new software is approaching **zero**, especially with LLMs. But what is the price of *understanding*, *testing*, and *trusting* that code? **Higher than ever**.

> LLMs reduce the time it takes to produce code, but they havenâ€™t changed the amount of effort required to reason about behavior, identify subtle bugs, or ensure long-term maintainability. That work can be even more challenging when reviewers struggle to distinguish between generated and handwritten code or understand why a particular solution was chosen.
