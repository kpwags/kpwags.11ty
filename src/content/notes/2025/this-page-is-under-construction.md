> I also don't want to be prescriptive about what this website should be. It's your space, and you can do with it whatever you want – whether that's a maximalist extravaganza, or plain text on a plain background. You might spent hours hand-crafting your HTML, or use a drag-and-drop builder. You may host it on someone else's platform, or on a box in your bedroom. All of these things are valid, as long as you build it *for you*.

I love tweaking my site and love seeing what others come up with. Keep on buildin’!
