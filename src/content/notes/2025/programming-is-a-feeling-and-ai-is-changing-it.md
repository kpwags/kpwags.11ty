> **Programming is an activity, but it’s also a feeling.** For those of us who actually enjoy programming, there is a deep satisfaction that comes from solving problems through well-written code, a kind of ineffable joy found in the elegant expression of a system through our favorite syntax. It is akin to the same satisfaction a craftsperson might find at the end of the day after toiling away on well-made piece of furniture, the culmination of small dopamine hits that come from sweating the details on something and getting them just right. Maybe nobody will notice those details, but it doesn’t matter. *We* care, *we* notice, *we* get joy from the aesthetics of the craft.

There really is something to be said about seeing the output of the code you write. Being able to see your code transform into a website or application is amazing.
