> The great works of Victorian England were erected by engineers who could not be sure of the properties of the materials they were using. In particular, whether by incompetence or malfeasance, the iron of the period was often not up to snuff. As a consequence, engineers erred on the side of caution, overbuilding to incorporate redundancy into their creations. The result was a series of centuries-spanning masterpieces.

> AI-security providers do not think like this. Conventional coding is a deterministic practice. Security vulnerabilities are seen as errors to be fixed, and when fixed, they go away. AI engineers, inculcated in this way of thinking from their schooldays, therefore often act as if problems can be solved just with more training data and more astute system prompts.

More risks from vibe coding. If you're going to use AI in production environments, you better be able to understand and work with the code it spits out.
