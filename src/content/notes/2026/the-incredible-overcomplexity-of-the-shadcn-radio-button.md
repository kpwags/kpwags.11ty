> I totally understand why people reach for component libraries like Shadcn and I don't blame them at all. But I wish these component libraries would keep things simple and reuse the built-in browser elements where possible.

I really don't get this. It's a radio button. Use the `accent-color` [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/accent-color). I whole heartedly agree with Paul, why add so much complexity to a control the browser does so well natively.
