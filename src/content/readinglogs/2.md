After stuffing Pocket with a bunch of articles, I've finally gotten around to going through them.
<!-- excerpt -->

<h2 class="old">In-Depth</h2>

{% inDepth "Jim Nielsen" "Website Fidelity" "https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/website-fidelity/" %}
I've tossed around the idea of figuring out a good way to deliver my blog in different modes as I have appreciated NPR and CNN's very basic sites. It's an interesting idea and challenge to provide better experiences for different users and their needs and/or abilities.
{% endinDepth %}

{% inDepth "Michael Shpilt" "8 reasons startups prefer Node.js over .NET, and are they justified?" "https://michaelscodingspot.com/node-js-vs-dotnet/" %}
Ever since moving over to the new .NET from the .NET Framework, I've realized it can be faster than ever to get up and running. .NET has [good templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates) to get you started. There are also now the [minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0) that can make things super simple.

At the end of the day though, I feel this is kind of a personal taste thing with no "right" answer. Both Node.js and .NET are fantastic platforms to get up and running with so companies and developers should really go with whichever they're more comfortable with. Good code can be written for either.
{% endinDepth %}

{% inDepth "Frontend Mastery" "The New Wave of JavaScript Web Frameworks" "https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-new-wave-of-javascript-web-frameworks/" %}
I remember building my first true interactive web app using PHP close to 15 years ago. Since then, the entire ecosystem has changed. Hell Chrome wasn't even a thing back then. It's remarkable to see the new frameworks and technologies continuing to evolve and improve. I'm pretty entrenched in React & TypeScript right now, but who knows what will happen over the next 5-10 years.
