As someone who enjoys reading about history, this was an in-depth look at one of the darkest periods in American history. The book is long, but it goes into so much depth about the battles, the characters involved, and the politics of both the Union and the Confederacy.

So much was going on in the country during the Civil War and James M. McPherson did a great job talking about what was happening throughout. For many of the battles, there were maps to go along with what was happening to visually help figure out troop movements. I found these helpful in many cases to get a better idea of where the armies were.

The political happenings on both sides was also well discussed which helped provide good context for how both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were dealing with what was going on behind the scenes with public sentiment.

This was a long read, but if you like history, well worth it.
