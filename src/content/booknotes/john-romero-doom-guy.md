I'm not one who generally likes memoirs, but this was an incredible listen about John Romero's life, growing up and gaining a legacy of one of the DOOM creators.

I remember getting DOOM and playing it and thought it was amazing. Listening to the history of how John Romero got into game development, programming in assembly, and how he, John Carmack, and the rest of Id got together to make one of the most iconic games ever was fascinating.

I'd highly recommend this for anyone who grew up playing DOOM or Quake. Or for anyone who is interested in an icon of the game industry.

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't inspiring to give me a little kick in the ass to do my own development, even if it's not necessarily games.
