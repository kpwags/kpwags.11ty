I had heard about this book on an [episode](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/ep-29-the-handmaidens-of-the-apocalypse/) of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Addendum podcast and quickly put a hold on it at on Libby.

The book is an interesting look at what nuclear war might look like. She interviewed countless Department of Defense officials as well as others who at points in their lives were involved with our nuclear war planning.

The insight she used from those interviews brought about an interesting story of what what might happen should nuclear war start. Explaining who the different people are and what their responsibilities would be. She goes through fantastic detail as to what could happen and what might be likely to happen.

Given the state of the world right now, it was a scary, but captivating read (or in my case, listen). It's also a stark reminder of how powerful these doomsday weapons are and how nuclear war really can't be won.

> After nuclear war, who, if anyone, will know we were once here.
