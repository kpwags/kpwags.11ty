If you haven’t already picked up on it, I’m a pretty big space geek. I love reading about it and have dreamed of going up into space. This book was right up my alley.

This book throws some cold water on humanity’s dream of truly settling space, at least in the near term. Kelly and Zach do a fantastic job of going through the different challenges, technologic, scientific and legal of us as a species venturing into space. They touch on a lot of things that we often don’t think about when talking about sending humans into space.

The book is fascinating and is written in such a way to be realistic about things, but also with the hope for the future and the caveats that there is much we don’t know and don’t have data for.

I’m a fan of Zach’s [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com) comics and this book has the same humor that he’s known for. If you enjoy space and science, I’d highly recommend this book.
