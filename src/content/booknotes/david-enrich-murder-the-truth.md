I found out about this book from an episode of the [Techdirt Podcast](https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/11/techdirt-podcast-episode-410-murder-the-truth/). I had heard about [NYT v Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan) and knew it was important with regards to free speech and journalism. This book does a good job talking about why the Sullivan decision is so important to the freedoms we enjoy in America, especially the freedom of the press.

The book goes on to describe the different attacks the rich and powerful are waging in the court systems to try to get Sullivan either overturned or weakened. From Donald Trump to rich and powerful coal executives, they don't like the fact that journalists and news outlets can dig up dirt and investigate what they're up to.

This should not be a partisan issue either as it protects both right and left-leaning journalists investigating those on either side of the political spectrum. It's an interesting and informative read about what's at stake with regards to holding the rich and powerful to account.
