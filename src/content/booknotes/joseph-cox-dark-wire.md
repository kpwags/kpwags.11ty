This was a fantastic dive into the history of the encrypted phone market. The book goes through the history of the previous encrypted phones like Phantom Secure, EncroChat, and SkyPhones and how those companies got charged, often with their founders facing criminal charges for intentionally supporting organized crime.

This all led to the creation of the primary focus of the book and the events that culminated in the creation of ANOM, the encrypted phone provider that was actually run by the FBI.

Joseph Cox does a good job digging into the characters involved on both sides of the phones; the criminals running their drug and organized crime empires, and the police organizations trying to shut them down. The way he tells the story is captivating and informative and in many cases feels like an old war movie with spies spying on spies. In reality, it kind of was.
