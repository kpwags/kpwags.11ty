		<h1>Works In Progress</h1>
		<p class="large">I work on various side projects. For me, it's fun to build things while learning new technologies that I might not otherwise get to use. This page is to talk about them.</p>

			<h2>Active Projects</h2>

				<h3>Wags Media Repository</h3>
				<p>If you look at my media pages (<a href="/bookshelf">Bookshelf</a>, <a href="/movies">Movies</a>, <a href="/music">Music</a>, <a href="/listening">Podcasts</a>, <a href="/tv">TV</a>, & <a href="/video-games">Video Games</a>), their content is generated by Notion's API where I keep the data stored and updated.</p>
				<p>This is currently up and running with a Node.js/Sqlite backend with a HTML/CSS/JS frontend. I'm still tweaking things, but it's pretty much done. Just small improvements.</p>

				<h3>Digital Family Cookbook</h3>
				<p>This is a .NET API / React Frontend app for cooking/baking recipe management system.</p>
				<p>I have a MVP of this just about done, but I know the UI/UX could be vastly improved. I hope to get back to it at some point to smooth it out and then finally release it.</p>

				<h3>Gamifit (Fitness Tracker)</h3>
				<p>I started this idea from the few Excel spreadsheets I use to keep track of my fitness progress. I am/was planning on building a web app to replace the spreadsheet with.</p>
				<p>I'm honestly not quite sure where this is at the moment. I've gone through multiple iterations where I've started it, didn't like how it was progressing, and started over.</p>

				<h3>Leegtastic (League Management System)</h3>
				<p>The system my local hockey rink uses to manage teams and rosters is absolutely awful. I joked about how I could do it better, so I decided to start building something. Currently using a .NET API which I have been working on, but am undecided what to use for the frontend. I've been going back and forth between Blazor and React.</p>

			<h2>Ongoing Utilities</h2>
			<p class="large">Projects that are more utilities for things I'm working on.</p>

			<article>
				<h3>Site Content Generator</h3>
				<p>I had and still have snippets in both VS Code and Sublime Text to build out the front matter for the markdown for my blog posts, notes, and book notes. But I built this .NET console app to build the markdown file with the front matter automatically given a few prompts.</p>
				<p>I also took the code from my reading log generator that creates the markdown for my weekly <a href="/reading-logs">reading logs</a> and included it here. For my reading logs, it both generates the front matter and the links from Notion.</p>

				<h3>Social Image Generator</h3>
				<p>This was a .NET console app that would generate the social image that would be attached to each post. I've given up on that currently, so this is pretty much in the dustbin.</p>

				<h3>Reading Log Generator</h3>
				<p>This is a .NET console app that creates the markdown for my weekly <a href="/reading-logs">reading logs</a>. Rather than manually going through and creating all the links, I have this tied into the Notion API to generate it with a single console command.</p>
				<p>I rolled the code into my site generator so I no longer need this.</p>
