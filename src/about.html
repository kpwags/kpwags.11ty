			Hi üëãüèª. My name is Keith, I'm a 40-something year old web developer living in the suburbs of Philadelphia,
			Pennsylvania. I graduated
			from Drexel University in 2007 with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and have since spent my career
			working on both front-end
			and back-end development with a specialty in the .NET ecosystem. I am fortunate to have found a career where
			I can do what I love
			doing. Seeing websites and applications come to life is such an awesome thing, even more so when you're the
			one building them.
		</p>

		<p>
			This site is my little oasis within the wide world of the internet. I often write about things I read or
			hear, challenges I find, and
			a variety of things going on in my busy life. I also do my best to keep a <a href="/reading-logs">weekly
				reading log</a> of what I
			read and listen to.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have a wide variety of interests which always keeps me busy. Some of them include: software development,
			photography, writing,
			hockey, running, cooking, drawing, video games, and more. In reality, it's too much to constantly keep up
			with, but I stumble through.
