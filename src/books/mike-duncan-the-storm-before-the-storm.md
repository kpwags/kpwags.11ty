This was an absolutely fascinating look at the Roman Republic leading up to the fall of the republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

I was referred to this book from an episode of [Hardcore History Addendum](https://www.dancarlin.com/addendum/). [Episode 2, Rome Through Duncan’s Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNB4P_i-Ph0) had Mike Duncan on to talk about this book.

The book goes through the different figures who were involved as well as some of the fateful decisions they made that would later weaken and doom the republic.

As someone who wasn’t super familiar with this era of history, this book did a great job of laying out the details of what the Roman Republic was and the history of the different wars and political intrigue that occurred.
