<h1>Work</h1>

<p>Below are some of the projects I've worked on over the years that have made it out into the wild. There are other
	side projects I've worked on that are in some state of half-built disarray.</p>

<work-project title="Wags Media Repository v1.0" status="Online"
	image="/img/work/wagsmediarepository/wags-media-repo-1.0.0.jpg"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/wags-media-repository">
	<p>I wanted to move off of React so I built the frontend with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. It could use some design fixes, but it's been working well.</p>
</work-project>

<work-project title="Wags Media Repository v0.2" status="Retired"
	image="/img/work/wagsmediarepository/wags-media-repository-0.2.0.jpg"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/wags-media-repository">
	<p>Due to local hosting options, Blazor and .NET turned out to not be a good option for this project. I ended up rebuilding it in Node.js and React. It does much of the same things, but can be easily hosted on my NAS.</p>
</work-project>

<work-project title="Wags Media Repository v0.1" status="Retired"
	image="/img/work/wagsmediarepository/wags-media-repo.png"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/wags-media-repository">
	<p>For a while I had been hosting the data for my links and media pages on Notion. It did a good job for that,
		but I decided I wanted to
		host the data myself. I have been using Blazor more so I built a quick MVP (minimal viable product) of it
		where I could add and edit
		my media for my site.</p>
	<p>I intend to "pretty" it up some and add more functionality over the next couple months.</p>
	<p>This is built using .NET 8, Blazor & Entity Framework.</p>
</work-project>

<work-project title="Where Do You Want to Eat? 2" status="Offline"
	image="/img/work/wheredoyouwanttoeat2/wheredoyouwanttoeat2.jpg"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat-2">
	<p>Several years ago, I built a little website. It was a simple little app that tied into Google's
		Geolocation API to find a restaurant near you, or by a specified Zip Code for you to eat at. It
		randomly chose it to help friends or couples choose their next meal.</p>
	<p>Google changed their API and started charging for it (which is completely fair, I'm not going to
		complain.). But because the site had no revenue and since there'd be the chance for a spike of
		usage upping the API costs, I opted to sunset it. You can still view the <a
			href="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat">GitHub Repository.</a></p>
	<p>This is the spiritual successor. Where Do You Want to Eat 2 is a web app that
		chooses where you go out to eat. We've all been there with friends and/or family. Trying to find a
		place to go and no one can decide or agree. This web app allows you to create an account, add
		restaurants, tag them, and let it choose where to go grab food.</p>
	<p>It is built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It uses Bootstrap for the UI.</p>

<work-project title="Where Do You Want to Eat?" status="Archived"
	image="/img/work/wheredoyouwanttoeat/where-do-you-want-to-eat.jpg"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat">
	<p>Ever have the back and forth with someone trying to figure out where you want to get food? Yeah,
		thought so.</p>
	<p>This random restaurant chooser was built using the Google Maps and Places API to get restaurants in
		the local area and choose one for the user to go to.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, Google changed their policies for their API and I had to deactivate it.</p>

<work-project title="OpenVoter" status="Archived" image="/img/work/openvoter/openvoter.png"
	github="https://github.com/kpwags/OpenVoter">
	<p>OpenVoter was a social media CMS written in PHP with a MySQL database backend. For the front-end, it
		utilized HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. It allowed users to run their own Digg or Reddit-like
		site. It was discontinued in 2012.</p>
