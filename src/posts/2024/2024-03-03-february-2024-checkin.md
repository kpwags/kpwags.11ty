February wasn't a bad month. It did seem to go by a little quickly though.
<!-- excerpt -->

## New Work Project

At work, the new project has started. I was originally going to write it in React & TypeScript, but requirements have changed slightly, and I'll be writing it in [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) instead. I've been working with Blazor at home on my league management side project and have been wanting to become more familiar with it, so this is a pretty sweet deal for me. I did end up having to throw some code out as I had already started in React, but a lot of the styling and HTML markup will translate over just about perfectly.

## Trip to Hershey

Towards the end of the month, Lauren and I went out to Hershey again. We spent a long weekend checking out some of the local breweries and distilleries. We had some good food, we had some good drink, and we had a good time. The weather was even nice for the end of February.

Also, at [Yah Brew](https://www.yahbrewco.com/home), I got to have a Strawberry Swirl Push Pop Sour, which did not look anything like a beer, but it was delicious all the same. Maybe one day I'll figure out how to brew it.

## Hobby Scheduling

At the beginning of the month, I decided to try something new. I have a bunch of things I'd like to work on this year and am often trying to balance my time between them. So I decided I'd try [scheduling them](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/02/08/scheduling-my-hobbies/). In reality, it's more just assigning different days to work on different things. I've been spending my Mondays and Fridays on my side project, Tuesdays and Thursdays on writing, Wednesdays on TV & video games, and weekends as whatever I want to do.

I've generally done a good job on focusing my side projects and writing, but Wednesdays have devolved from TV & video games, to also whatever I want to work on. I've spent Wednesdays writing, and working on my side projects, but I think that's okay. It's giving me time to focus on what I want to work on and I think part of it is helping me feel like I'm not neglecting one thing over the other.
