One thing you might have recently noticed is there is now a new header option called “Notes” on my site. I saw [Jim Nielsen’s notes page](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/) and liked the idea so I decided to implement my own version.
<!-- excerpt -->

For me, notes will be where I share links that are interesting to me, but where I want to add a little bit of context or a little bit of my own thoughts, or (ahem) *notes* on it. Think of them like tweets or toots with a link and a few of my thoughts on the matter.

As with reading logs & book notes, they’ll have their own separate RSS feed, but will also be included in my global feed.
