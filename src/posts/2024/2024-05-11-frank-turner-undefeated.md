I’ve been a fan of Frank Turner since I first heard his album *[England Keep My Bones](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kRslN3ZtS6exwxvtcx3qIww8SZvAXieAg&si=rnHpt0XiXYB1fgBJ)* back in 2010. He’s an English folk/punk songwriter and his live shows and his albums have thus far been phenomenal. A little over a week ago on May 3rd, Frank Turner released his latest album *Undefeated*.
<!-- excerpt -->

The album is another solid release by Frank Turner. My favorite songs from the album are *Do One*, *Ceasefire*, & *Letters*.

## Do One

> Some people are just going to hate you. No matter what you do. So don’t waste Your time trying to change their minds, just be a better you. It took me year to learn this. More than I’d like to admin. But through my ups and downs I’ve figured one thing out. Don’t take anyone’s shit. I’m still standing up, and there’s nothing you can do.

I love that first verse. I relate to it personally as growing up, I was overly worried about how other people felt about me. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that was no good and to recognize that all I can do is try to be a good person and ignore them.

## Ceasefire

This is another good one that talks about the conflict between one's younger self and the person one's become. We've all had dreams as kids that might not have worked out. Sometimes for the worse, but sometimes for the better, even if we don't realize it.

> I know I'm not everything that you had hoped and imagined that I would be. But I did my best. And I have seen things that you don't even know that you've never seen. We need to find some common ground. In the ruins that still stand. Between you and me, both of us want peace. Ceasefire

## Letters

This is a great song. The lyrics talk about him falling out of communication with someone. And it makes me think about how I loved getting letters growing up and miss it. I also look at how easy it is, especially as an adult, to fall out of touch with someone and drift apart.
