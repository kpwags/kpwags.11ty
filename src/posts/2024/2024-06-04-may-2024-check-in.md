I legitimately can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre already past May and into June. May was mostly quiet.

## Back Working on Leegtastic...Briefly

After taking a break to work on a website for my wife, I got back to working on Leegtastic (my sports league management side project). Having been doing Blazor development at work for the last several months, I realized I was over-engineering some things. I jumped back in and simplified the code to hopefully make it better and easier to work with.

But almost as soon as I got back to working on that, another idea came to mind. I've been storing the data for my media pages ([bookshelf](https://kpwags.com/bookshelf/), [video games](https://kpwags.com/video-games/), [TV](https://kpwags.com/tv/), etc.) in Notion. When my site builds, it pulls the data from the Notion API and builds the pages. I thought it would be nice to build a little Blazor app to store all of that locally. Then I'd change the 11ty build process to use that data instead. It's still a work in progress, but that's been my side project focus of late.

## Started Week Notes

Halfway through the month, I decided I'm going to try to start posting week notes every Sunday about things I've been doing or working on. I've done three of them so far, so we'll see if I stick with it or not.

## Getting Back into Running

Over the last 6+ months, my runs have felt like more of a death march rather than some exercise. I felt like I wanted to die after 3 miles. Runs that used to be relatively "easy" for me. After a visit to the doctor didn't turn up anything I ended up [trying something new](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/05/23/finding-a-new-way-to-run/). Keeping my heart rate in zone 2 has helped tremendously. I'm running longer and further, and feeling good after them. My pace is kind of lousy, but I'm able to do my preferred cardio exercise again, so I'm happy.
