Yesterday, January 9, 2024 my wife and I had to say goodbye to our sweet cat Cookie. She was 14 1/2 years old.
<!-- excerpt -->

I got Cookie before my wife and I were together when Cookie was a kitten. I remember I could hold her in the palm of my hand she was so tiny. She came with fleas and with ear mites, but quickly got her healthy and on the mend. Of the two cats I had at the time, she was always the sweet one.

She got me through some tough times in my life. She didn’t know what was going on, or the troubles I was struggling with, but she seemed to know something was up and made sure to cuddle more.

She was sometimes mischievous, getting into places she shouldn’t. She was the epitome of a curious cat. She loved attention, she loved the pets, and oh boy did she love food. She became somewhat of a chonkers before I realized it and had to be more mindful how much I fed her. (In my defense, my first cat was very much a grazer and would only eat when she was hungry.)

She was the sweetest cat I had ever met and she was sweet and loving to the very end. She always wanted cuddles. If I was sitting on the couch, she would want to wedge herself in between me and the armrest. If I was lying in bed, she wanted to be right next to me, and sometimes on top of me. It wouldn’t take much to get her to start purring. A little scritch behind the ears or some chin scritches and she turned into putty. She was such a loving cat and I’m going to miss her so much.

As my wife has said,

> “I’m not sure if cats can love, but Cookie definitely can.”
