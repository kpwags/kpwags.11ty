I’ve set some goals for myself this year and I decided I’m going to try something new in hopes that it helps me achieve them. It’s going to sound silly, but hey, let’s try it.
<!-- excerpt -->

My wife mentioned reading about someone who scheduled their hobbies for a specific night of the week. I had at one point considered doing something similar, and decided that it was a sign or something along those lines to try it myself. For the next month or so I’m going to try to dedicate each day of the week towards a specific hobby.

- **Mondays & Fridays:** My side project
- **Tuesdays & Thursdays:** Writing
- **Wednesdays:** Video Games and/or TV
- **Saturdays & Sundays:** Whatever

I’m not going to plan anything specific for the weekends. I figure I might need them to run errands, do housework, or something of the like. I also don’t really want to make things too rigid, life’s too short for that.

With regards to the week, I’m not going to say “no” to alternative plans if something comes up or anything. I’ll still have hockey 1-2 nights a week, and housework never ends. What I’m just going to do is have a different focus each evening of the week. If something comes up that evening, I’ll skip whatever it was I was going to do and just move on. I’m not going to try to squeeze it in the next day either.

I’m also going to continue to set aside the final hour of my waking day to read. I find that sitting down and reading for about 45 minutes to an hour helps calm me down to help me fall asleep.

I’m gonna try this for the next month or so and see how it goes. If I like it, great, I’ll keep at it. If I don’t, oh well, no big deal. Might help to break up my activities as well to keep each one fresh.
