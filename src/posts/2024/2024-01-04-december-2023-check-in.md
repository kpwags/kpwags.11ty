December kind of sucked. Halfway through the month, I caught bronchitis, and it took me 2 weeks to finally kick it to the curb. This completely curtailed the Christmas festivities as I definitely did not want to spread this to anyone else.
<!-- excerpt -->

The month started off well enough. The first weekend I was able to brew some beer. I ended up brewing a clone of Harpoon‚Äôs Winter Warmer. I just bottled it so I‚Äôll find out in a bit if it‚Äôs any good, but it was fun to brew another batch as it had been a little while.

I also went to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms teddy bear toss game. It was fun throwing all the stuffed animals onto the ice after the Phantoms scored their first goal. The ended up winning 4-1 which made it even sweeter.

Unfortunately that was the peak of the month. I caught bronchitis and probably laryngitis, and the rest of the month was me coughing up a lung barely able to speak. I was initially hopeful that I‚Äôd be able to recover in time for Christmas, but then it wouldn‚Äôt give, and then my wife caught it and we were both down for the count. All things considered though, we had a nice quiet Christmas together, coughing aside.

Another good thing that came out of it was that I was able to finish migrating my site from Next.js to Eleventy. Shortly after Christmas, I took my Next.js implementation offline and replaced it with Eleventy. So far, I‚Äôm quite happy with the result.

The rest of the month was just us taking it easy.
