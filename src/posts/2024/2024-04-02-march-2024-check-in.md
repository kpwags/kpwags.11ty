March was a very quiet month for me. There really wasn‚Äôt much of anything to note. I lead a mostly boring life which I do believe is a good thing.
<!-- excerpt -->

## Hobby Scheduling

I mentioned this last month, but I‚Äôve bee following the [schedule](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/02/08/scheduling-my-hobbies/) I set out to try to help balance what I focus on. It‚Äôs been going mostly well. I‚Äôve made good progress on my story and am almost at 30,000 words. I‚Äôve made good progress on my league management web app. I also have been able to get some TV & gaming time in. Halo was [interesting](https://kpwags.com/posts/2024/03/26/some-thoughts-on-the-halo-tv-series/), I enjoyed [Mass Effect](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect), started its sequel, and have gotten back into Road to the Show in [MLB the Show 24](https://theshow.com).

## Work Project

The project I‚Äôve been working on in Blazor has been going well. I‚Äôm learning a lot between both my side projects and at work and am liking the developer tools for it. I‚Äôve also gotten better at bringing in tests using the [bUnit library](https://bunit.dev).

## Fitness

Lifting has been somewhat sporadic which I‚Äôm trying to correct in April. It was partly the cause of the increased walking in March. The infrequency of lifting caused leg soreness which pushed me more towards walking over runs. I‚Äôm hoping as the weather gets nicer, I can balance exercise out more.
