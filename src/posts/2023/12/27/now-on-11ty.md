You might have noticed some changes to the site. That’s expected as it is now running on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
<!-- excerpt -->

I mentioned earlier I was going to [move away from Next.js](https://kpwags.com/posts/2023/12/06/moving-away-from-nextjs) and that move is now complete. Hopefully everything will be running properly and if you get overloaded by old posts in my RSS feed, I’m sorry (not sure how that will end up working).

I’m looking forward to continuing to write and continuing to improve my site.
