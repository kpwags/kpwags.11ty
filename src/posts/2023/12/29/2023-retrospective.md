Another year has come and gone. I’m a year older and I suppose a little wiser, though the latter one is a little hard to judge. I had a good year and really can’t complain.

## Looking Back at 2023

The biggest happening of 2023 was probably Lauren and I celebrating our 10 year anniversary. We ended up spending almost 2 weeks in Aruba and it was amazing. Hot, but amazing. Sometimes I find it hard to believe we’ve been married for 10 years. There are times where it doesn’t feel nearly that long, and there are other times where I can’t remember a time without her.

Some other things that happened:

- **Won the I-League Championship:** The team I play goalie for won the championship in the winter season. It’s just beer league hockey, but it was fun and memorable.
- **Started Writing More:** I started to write more at the end of September. I started writing a story and have been writing more blog posts.
- **Worked on Side Projects:** Over the course of the year I’ve worked on various side projects (never finishing any of course) using React, TypeScript, Blazor, Astro, and more.
- **Went on Some Trips:** Traveled to Hershey, PA, Cape May, NJ, New York City, Baltimore and more. Mostly just weekend or long weekend trips, but they were still fun.
- **Rebuilt My Site:** I rebuilt my site using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Seeing the JS bundle size of Next.js going up, I decided to switch over to a different platform.

## My 2023 Goals

### 1. Re-Learn Guitar

I wanted to teach myself 10 “modern” rock songs. Can’t say I even learned one. The only thing I can say is that I’ve been playing with my guitar most days of late and am starting to get the hang of switching chords again.

### 2. Read 30 Books

I’m on my 42nd book of the year now, so this was a resounding success. Most nights I’ve been spending a good 45 minutes to an hour reading before crawling into bed. Hockey nights especially since I’m generally too amped up to sleep anyway.

### 3. Write 12 Technical Posts

I can’t say I hit 12 technical posts, but I did hit 10. Better than last year, but I also have written more this year for my blog than any other so the failure is a little muted.

### 4. Hit the 1,000 lbs. Club

My goal this year was to hit 1,000 lbs. total across deadlift, squat, & bench press. I managed 400 lbs. on deadlifts, 365 lbs. on squats, and 240 lbs. on bench press for a grand total of 1,005 lbs. Mission accomplished. I immediately deloaded and have been slowly working my way back up focusing on reps as well as sheer weight.

### 5. Bike & Run 400 Miles Each

Yeah, this didn’t happen. I never really got into the groove much with running and hip/groin injuries didn’t help matters.

### 6. Take More Photos

Outside of taking photos for my sister-in-law’s wedding, I didn’t end up taking my camera out any.
