Yesterday I had my first brew day in almost 2 years. I ended up brewing a Harpoon [Winter Warmer](https://www.harpoonbrewery.com/beer/winter-warmer/) clone.

I was able to get all the ingredients the night before and the day thankfully went mostly smoothly. The only hiccup was that I ran out of sparging water and had to quickly heat some more up. Other than that, things went well and hopefully in a month or so I’ll have 2 dozen plus 22 ounce bottles of winter beer.

The big downside of brewing is that it takes a while to know if you screwed up.

One more note, I actually did buy a 6-pack of Harpoon’s Winter Warmer to compare with when all is said and done.
